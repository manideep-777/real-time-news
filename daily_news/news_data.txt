Mango Trade Tensions: Karnataka Appeals for Lifting Ban in Andhra Pradesh The ongoing tension between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh over the entry of Totapuri mangoes has reached a critical point. Karnataka's Chief Secretary, Shalini Rajneesh, has formally requested her Andhra Pradesh counterpart to lift the ban affecting mango imports into Chittoor district.Rajneesh termed the restriction as an 'abrupt and unilateral' move, which has severely impacted the livelihood of mango farmers in Karnataka, particularly those in the border areas. She highlights that these farmers depend on Chittoor-based processing units to sell their produce.She further expressed concerns that this decision undermines cooperative federalism, possibly inciting retaliatory measures from Karnataka and escalating inter-state tensions. A collaborative effort to address trade and phytosanitary issues is essential, according to Rajneesh.

The protestors, led by District Women's Wing President Lakshmi Sunanda, claimed that the coalition government has failed to safeguard women, despite having a female Home Minister.Jagan Mohan Reddy, YSRCP President, criticized the arrest of journalist Kommineni Srinivasa Rao and alleged 'organized' attacks on Sakshi media offices. He accused Chandrababu Naidu of misrepresenting Kommineni's words to justify the arrest, condemning the acts as a deliberate attack on democracy.Jagan lambasted Naidu for failing to protect women and cited shocking cases of violence under TDP's watch. He alleged that fake promises and media manipulation are being used to divert attention from unfulfilled promises and women's safety concerns. The opposition insists that diversion tactics will not elude accountability forever.

She cited Reddy's support for every bill the BJP-led Centre introduced over the past five years as evidence of the alliance.Responding to accusations from YSRCP leader Roja Selvamani about her alleged support for TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu, Sharmila clarified that she had not supported the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister. She expressed her disappointment over what she described as false propaganda and malicious campaigns from the YSRCP.

Jagan Mohan Reddy Condemns Journalist's Arrest and Media Attacks in Andhra Pradesh YSR Congress Party leader YS Jagan Mohan Reddy strongly criticized the arrest of veteran journalist Kommineni Srinivasa Rao and the attacks on a vernacular news channel, denouncing these actions as an attack on democratic principles. Reddy's condemnation came after Rao was detained in Hyderabad for allegedly hosting a program with controversial remarks about Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh's planned capital city.In a social media post, Reddy accused Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu of distorting facts and orchestrating violence to deflect criticism and avoid accountability. He challenged the legitimacy of Rao's arrest, arguing that he was wrongfully implicated for merely moderating a debate, suggesting that the state government was misusing its power under the guise of protecting women's dignity.Furthermore, Reddy highlighted instances of alleged government insensitivity, referring to the recent murder of a tribal girl and a gang rape case involving a minor. He criticized the ruling party for failing to uphold promised protections and accused it of leveraging political pressure to silence victims and families. The opposition leader highlighted discrepancies between previous and current administrations, alleging that the NDA alliance neglected critical sectors like education and health.

Madurai: In an important directive that has brought both relief to Hindu outfits and a sharp spotlight on the Tamil Nadu police’s alleged bias, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has instructed the state police to decide on applications from the Hindu Munnani seeking permission to hold a major Bhagwan Murugan devotees’ conference on June 22. This ruling comes as a perceived blow to the Dravida Model DMK government, which has been accused by Hindu organisations and the opposition BJP of consistently denying permissions for their events, protests, and rallies, including even national flag hoisting. Justice B Pugalendi, after hearing submissions from the police, directed them to make a final decision on the permission by June 12. While the court allowed the petitioner to proceed with setting up miniatures of Bhagwan Murugan’s six abodes and conduct poojas at the conference venue from June 10 to 22, it explicitly stated that no ceremonial worship (poojas) should be conducted until a definitive decision on the conference permission is granted. The court further questioned the police’s rationale for denying permission for the Madurai Murugan conference when a similar event in Palani had been permitted by the DMK government, highlighting a perceived double standard. The hearing has been adjourned to June 13. Read More: India at the G7 Summit: Canadian PM Mark Carney reveals why he invited PM Modi to the meet The “Muruga Bhakthargal Aanmeega Mahanaadu” (Bhagwan Murugan Devotees’ Spiritual Mega Conference), envisioned by the Hindu Munnani, plans to host a vibrant array of cultural and spiritual programmes, including the chanting of Kanda Shasti Kavasam and Thiruppugazh. Organisers anticipate a massive turnout of over 5 lakh devotees, signaling the event’s scale and potential impact. The proposed list of attendees further elevates the conference’s profile, with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan, and other prominent dignitaries from across Bharat, along with film stars, politicians, and industrialists, slated to attend the mega event on June 22 in Madurai. The Thiruparankundram Hill Controversy: A Core Flashpoint At the heart of this highly anticipated spiritual gathering lies a deeply contentious issue: the event is being strategically positioned as a “launch pad to wage a war” against persistent attempts to rename the ancient Thiruparankundram hill as “Sikkandar Hill.” Thiruparankundram, one of Bhagwan Murugan’s six primary abodes, holds immense spiritual and historical significance for Hindus. The move to rename it after Sikandar Shah, a 13th-century ruler of the Delhi Sultanate who briefly controlled the Madurai region, has ignited fierce opposition from Hindu groups. Critics allege that this renaming demand is championed by some fundamentalist Muslim outfits, enjoying the tacit or explicit support of what they term “urban naxals,” left parties, various Dravidian parties including AIADMK, Naam Tamizhar Katchi, Vijay Joseph’s TVK, and other “tukede tukede” elements. These groups are accused of harboring a “strong Hindu phobic nature and aversion against Sanatana parties,” thereby fueling the renaming agenda. Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently weighed in on the contentious issue during his visit to Madurai. “The DMK government has the audacity to call our thousand-year-old Thirupparankundram mountain as Sikandar Mountain. The DMK government is doing this for separatist and political gains. We should participate in the Muruga devotees’ conference to be held on June 22 and show our strength,” Shah declared, explicitly linking the conference to the broader political and religious battle. This statement immediately drew a sharp retort from CPIM MP from Madurai, Su. Venkatesan, who took to social media platform X to challenge Shah’s historical narrative. “Thirupparankundram hill, a thousand years old,” says Amit Shah. Parankundram is a Tamil word three thousand years old. The conspiracy of Sanatana lies in reducing it to a thousand years. While claiming Sanskrit is tens of thousands of years old, their politics, from Keeladi to Thirupparankundram, is to confine Tamil within a thousand years,” Venkatesan posted, alleging a deliberate attempt to downplay Tamil antiquity. “ஆயிரம் ஆண்டு பழமையான திருப்பரங்குன்றம் மலை” என்கிறார் அமித்ஷா. பரங்குன்றம் என்பது மூவாயிரம் ஆண்டு பழமையான தமிழ் சொல். அதனை ஆயிரம் ஆண்டு என சுருக்குவதில் தான் சனாதனத்தின் சதி இருக்கிறது. சமஸ்கிருதத்தை பல்லாயிரம் ஆண்டு என்று சொல்லிக்கொண்டே தமிழை ஆயிரம் ஆண்டுக்குள் அடக்குவது தான்... pic.twitter.com/Mpyg1ytkPf — Su Venkatesan MP (@SuVe4Madurai) June 8, 2025 Responding to Su. Venkatesan’s remarks, BJP IT wing functionary Tinku Venkatesh offered a counter-argument on X, asserting the hill’s continuous Hindu identity. “...You admit Thiruparankundram is 3000 years old, that means it belongs to Lord Murugan alone, every stone, every street,” Tinku Venkatesh countered, reinforcing the Hindu claim over the ancient site. Amit Shah said Saalon se – many yearsTranslator clearly says பல ஆயிரம் ஆண்டுகளாக This isn’t poor understanding Your lying & twisting You admit Thiruparankundram is 3000 years old, that means it belongs to Lord Murugan alone, every stone, every street @SuVe4Madurai Agree ? https://t.co/JelHGhCM6v pic.twitter.com/rYf5GwaEpu — Tinku Venkatesh | ಟಿಂಕು ವೆಂಕಟೇಶ್ (@tweets_tinku) June 9, 2025 Political Rhetoric Heats Up The political implications of the Murugan conference have fueled a heated war of words between various parties. P. Shanmugam, the CPI(M) Tamil Nadu state secretary, accused the BJP of exploiting religious sentiments for electoral gain. In a post on X, he stated, “This is not a spiritual conference, but a political meeting aimed at advancing the BJP’s agenda. From the national leadership to local functionaries, BJP leaders are involved in mobilising people for this event... They want to turn Tamil Nadu into a land of strife using Lord Murugan as a political tool.” Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) chief Seeman, known for his often-inconsistent public statements, weighed in from Thirumayam in Pudukottai district on June 8. Claiming to be a “grandson of Lord Murugan,” Seeman accused the BJP of engaging in communal politics. “There is a value for Murugan in the state. Why did not you (BJP) elevate Him all these days? You take up Rama in UP, Puri’s Jagannath in Odisha, Ayyappa in Kerala and then Murugan here. Do you think people here will be deceived?” he questioned, suggesting a selective and opportunistic religious outreach by the BJP. Responding to these criticisms, TN BJP chief Nainar [...]
