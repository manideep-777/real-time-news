            "content": "TIRUPATI: Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has urged mango farmers and pulp industries to work together to ensure fair prices for farmers, and sustained operation of processing units. He held an urgent review meeting with mango farmers, pulp industry representatives, and processing units of the erstwhile undivided Chittoor district on Thursday.Naidu directed the processing and pulp industries to immediately purchase mangoes from farmers to provide them relief. He assured that the government would also support the pulp and processing industries. He said the government would formulate a long-term plan to prevent future issues for mango farmers.Farmers brought to Naidu’s attention that pulp industries were not purchasing mangoes, citing a lack of orders and storage space. Some farmers also reported that unloading itself was taking 3-4 days in certain areas. Responding to this, the Chief Minister instructed processing units and pulp industry representatives to immediately purchase the produce and support farmers.Mango pulp industries and exporters informed the Chief Minister that Pakistan and African countries have no import duties, while European countries impose high import duties. They urged Naidu to take up the matter with the Centre to persuade the European countries to reduce import duty. They also appealed for a reduction in GST on mango pulp from 12% to 5%. In response, the Chief Minister said he had already written to the Centre regarding the GST reduction, and would follow up on the matter again.Naidu emphasised that while farmers should receive a good price for their mangoes, processing units and pulp industries also need to maintain viability. Industry representatives proposed considering including mango juice in the mid-day meal scheme for students. The Chief Minister noted that eggs are currently provided as a nutritional component in mid-day meals, but assured that the suggestion would be studied for future consideration.The Chief Minister advised mango farmers to adopt best practices, avoiding excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides. He stressed the importance of adhering to global standards for testing, tracing, and certification to ensure the marketability of their produce worldwide.He reiterated that processing industries should purchase mangoes from farmers according to their capacity to ensure justice for the farmers. He explicitly stated that farmers should be paid `8 per kg without any waiting period.District Collector Sumit Kumar said 33 mango processing units and farmers participated in the meeting. He informed the Chief Minister that 30 mango processing units are operational in Chittoor district, with a combined capacity of 7,000 metric tonnes, and are currently collecting 6,500 metric tonnes. The Collector added that 1.12 lakh metric tonnes of mangoes have been purchased from farmers so far.Tata Digital Nerve Centre comes up in KuppamTIRUPATI: The State’s first Tata Digital Nerve Centre (DiNC) has come up in Kuppam. The project, developed under the Tata Bridgital Framework, aims to revolutionise public health delivery by digitally integrating all Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, and government hospitals.Inaugurating the project, along with Health Minister Y Satya Kumar Yadav on Thursday, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said, “This digital healthcare revolution will empower every citizen with continuous and quality medical care.

EAGLE chief Ake Ravi Krishna and his team, Eluru law and order police, RPF, and GRP participated in the surprise inspections on trains as part of a drive to check trains and ensure no narcotic substances are transported. Divided into various teams, the officials boarded the Coromandel Express in Eluru and inspected all train coaches thoroughly. When the EAGLE chief inspected the luggage of passengers in the S4 coach, he found ganja converted into a round shape and wrapped in chocolate covers. The man was taken into custody and the ganja was seized. He was later brought to Vijayawada railway station and handed over to Vijayawada GRP police. “Along with the accused Subhash Kumar Yadav, four others were travelling to Chennai. The accused used to work in a tea stall and purchased the ganja chocolates from a shop in his village for personal consumption,” said the GRP police. A case was registered against him and he will be produced in court on Friday. On the other hand, as part of Operation Vijay, the EAGLE conducted surprise inspections at Eluru Railway Station on Thursday.

Now, the Revanth Reddy government is at a complete loss. But the actual losers are the state and the people.” “The Congress when in power before Telangana formation launched many projects but did not complete them, and the BRS after coming to power in the state, also ignored them. Now, the two parties are busy enacting a drama blaming one another and challenging each other for debates on the issue. The two sides should stop this back and forth and unnecessary blaming of the BJP at the Centre for the problems they created,” he said.",

            "content": "Kurnool: There is an acute shortage of non-judicial stamp papers across Kurnool district. This has created severe hardships for buyers and sellers registering property. In fact, the shortage has been going on for the past several months, forcing people to depend on e-stamps. Taking advantage, several vendors are reportedly selling e-stamps at inflated rates, charging three to four times the actual value. For example, a Rs 10 stamp is being sold for as much as Rs 30–40, while Rs 20 and Rs 50 denominations are going for Rs 50 and Rs 150 respectively. Many buyers have complained that the registration department is indifferent to their plight, as officials maintain that making stamp papers available is not their concern. There had been 24 sub-registrar offices in erstwhile Kurnool district. However, adequate non-judicial stamps are not being supplied to them, mainly because the district registrar’s office has failed to maintain stock levels. This has left people entirely dependent on e-stamps. Compounding the problem, the booking counter at the district registrar’s office—which previously sold stamps—has remained closed for the past three to four months after the ACB arrested an employee posted there in a corruption case. Since then, no replacement has been appointed, and the counter has remained shut. Significantly, the shortage has not remained limited to non-judicial stamps alone. Revenue stamps, court stamps, special adhesive stamps, and franking stamps are also scarce, creating widespread inconvenience. People running the franking centres are also collecting extra amounts from the public for franking their documents. Sources allege that the e-stamping stockholder responsible for supplying e-stamps to Kurnool, Nandyal, Anantapur, and Prakasam districts has deliberately created an artificial scarcity. Vendors claim that stamps are supplied only if they deposit registration challans through the stockholder’s account. As a result, e-stamps are not available on time, driving up prices in the open market. Surprisingly, officials, when questioned, say the matter has not come to their attention. Once that happens, they will take action.",

            "content": "Amaravati, Jul 3 (PTI) Farmers offering land under the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) Rules, 2025, will be entitled to residential plots of up to 1,000 sq yards and commercial plots of up to 450 sq yards, along with other financial and social benefits, an official said on Thursday. S Suresh Kumar, Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD), said farmers surrendering an acre of patta (documented) dry land for the greenfield capital city of Amaravati will receive a 1,000 sq yard residential plot and a 250 sq yard commercial plot. For an acre of jareebu land (irrigated or riverbank lands), farmers will be allotted a 1,000 sq yard residential plot and a 450 sq yard commercial plot. Landowners offering land under five other categories will receive plots of varying sizes in Amaravati. “The newly formulated LPS Rules broadly adopt the package and social benefits outlined in the 2015 Capital City LPS Rules but introduce key enhancements,” Kumar said in a press release. The new Land Pooling Scheme rules come as the government plans to turn the greenfield capital city of Amaravati into a ‘mega city’ by merging adjacent Mangalagiri, Tadepalli, Guntur, and Vijayawada with Amaravati. The plan involves pooling an additional 40,000 acres of land, in addition to the 54,000 acres already acquired for Amaravati. The TDP-led NDA government also plans to build an international airport in Amaravati. In addition to reconstituted plots, landowners and eligible families will receive benefits including an annual annuity of Rs 30,000 for dry land and Rs 50,000 for jareebu land, with annual increments of Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 respectively. Farmers pooling orchard land—such as lime, sapota, or guava—will receive a one-time additional payment of Rs 1 lakh. Other benefits include a monthly pension of Rs 5,000 for 10 years for each landless poor family, a one-time agricultural loan waiver of Rs 1.5 lakh for eligible farming families, and free education and healthcare for residents upon declaration of intent. Additional welfare measures include old age homes for the elderly and needy, subsidised food through Anna Canteens, and the use of tractors and machinery from local farmers in development works. \"These new rules reflect the government's commitment to fast-tracking the Capital Region's development while ensuring inclusive growth for all stakeholders,\" Kumar said. The new LPS Rules are designed to be simplified, citizen-friendly, and integrated with technology to enhance transparency and security, the release added. Water bodies will be strictly preserved in line with National Green Tribunal (NGT) and Supreme Court directives, and reconstituted plot details will be directly entered into the registration system. The new regulations come amid rapid development in Amaravati, which is witnessing swift infrastructure and urban expansion, Kumar said. This growth is expected to significantly impact surrounding rural areas, leading to the development of new urban settlements, satellite towns, and agglomerations, he added. The government has emphasised the need for investment in urban infrastructure and services to transform these cities into engines of development, capable of lifting millions out of poverty and driving long-term economic growth, Kumar added.

            "content": "A YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) delegation led by Parliamentary Party leader Y. V. Subba Reddy, along with MPs P.V. Mithun Reddy and Bellana Chandrasekhar, met the Election Commission of India (ECI) in Delhi on Thursday (July 03) to express concerns over the conduct of the 2024 General Elections in Andhra Pradesh. The YSRCP leaders raised serious doubts about the integrity of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), citing technical anomalies, mismatches in VVPAT slips, and a suspicious last-hour spike in voter turnout. In Andhra Pradesh, the polling percentage increased in many constituencies after 6 p.m. Out of around 4 crore votes across the State, approximately 51 lakh votes were cast in the last hour alone, which raises several suspicions. By the end of polling, the batteries were charged to 80%. However, by the time of counting, 40 days later, we observed that the charge had increased to nearly 98%. “We are also demanding an investigation into this matter,” they said, adding: “We are demanding an investigation into this. However, the Election Commission officials firmly stated that comparing VVPATs is not possible.” The delegation demanded a Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in Andhra Pradesh, similar to Bihar, and sought a shift back to ballot paper voting, citing its continued use in countries like the U.S., Germany, and others. They argued that the credibility of India’s electoral process can only be restored through transparent, manual voting. Despite assurances from the ECI to examine some of the data, the YSRCP maintains that future elections must be held through ballot paper to ensure fairness and public trust.",

            "content": "The former chief minister met on Thursday. Vamsi, who has been in jail for five months in several cases, including the attack on the Gannavaram TDP office, was released on bail on Wednesday on July 2. It is reported that Jagan has been discussed with the family at his residence with the family of Vamsi. Vamsi was arrested by the police on February 16 in the attack on the Gannavaram TDP office. He then filed several cases against him. A total of 11 cases were reported in prison for 140 days. He has been accused of attacking the Gannavaram TDP office, such as fake houses and lands of land. Due to these cases, he has been in the Vijayawada district jail for the past five months as a remand prisoner. Vamsi became sick many times while in prison. He was also treated at the hospital with respiratory problems. The Nuzvid court granted bail in the latest fake rails case. This has paved the way for his release with all the cases against Vamsi. There were several dramatic developments before the release. The Andhra Pradesh government has approached the Supreme Court seeking the abolition of bail by the High Court in the illegal mining case. The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard the petition and doubted the release of Vallabhani Vamsi. However, the Supreme Court was not interested. However, the AP government's lawyer Siddhartha Luthra argued that the High Court had acted unilaterally without listening to their arguments in advance bail. He said that Rs 195 crore had been illegal mining. The Supreme Court believes that the pre -bail issue will be considered after the report. The hearing was postponed to July 16. This has led to the disruption of the release of Vallabhaneni Vamsi. Almost 5 months later from the prison, Vamsi's wife Pankajashree was emotional.",

Nellore (Andhra Pradesh) [India], July 3 (ANI): Police have begun an investigation into the case in which a student of a private college in Nellore in Andhra Pradesh was found dead under suspicious circumstances on the college premises. After a complaint was lodged, Rural Sub Inspector Lakshman said, \"We have launched an inquiry, and an investigation is currently underway. Further details will be revealed as the case progresses.\" The deceased, Sai Revanth, a resident of the Dargamitta area on Dicast Road in Nellore, was a second-year Intermediate student at Viswa Sai College here. The grieving parents of the deceased have demanded a thorough inquiry and justice in the matter. On Tuesday, his parents said they had dropped him off at college in the morning. The deceased's father, Sairam, said that Revanth had called him and told him about abuse and harassment from his classmates. The man revealed that he had spoken to the college principal regarding the issue, but no action was taken. \"Last evening, Revanth called me and said that a few of his classmates were abusing and harassing him. He asked me to speak to the principal. I spoke with the principal, but no action was taken. Today, we received the devastating news that he was found dead under suspicious circumstances. We demand a thorough inquiry,\" the deceased student's father said. Meanwhile, the deceased student's aunt, Jyothi, said that her family had asked the college authorities not to pressurise Sairam for his marks and academic performance. She demanded a proper investigation into the matter and said that the family suspects mental harassment as the cause behind his demise. \"We had clearly told the college not to pressurise him about marks.

Revanth was a good human being,\" she said.

He used to suffer from stomach pain, yet the family chose to continue his studies here. We firmly state that there was no pressure from our side\", he said. (ANI)",

The incident occurred while Yerayya was line fishing with others. Despite search efforts, he remains missing. This incident follows a similar tragedy in February 2022, where fisherman Molli Joganna died after being impaled by a marlin.",
            "content": "VISAKHAPATNAM: A 26-year-old fisherman went missing in the sea after a large fish pulled him into sea while fishing in the blue waters (15 nautical miles off Bay of Bengal) in north coastal Andhra Pradesh. The missing person has been identified as Chodapalli Yerayya, a native of Pudimadaka coastal village in Atchutapuram mandal in Anakapalle district. Yerayya went fishing along with three others from Pudimadaka in a motorized boat on Wednesday morning. After sprawling the bait (line fishing method), Yerayya on board was pulling it. However, a large blue marlin (locally known as kommu konam) fish took the bait and Yerayya was unprepared for the force of the fish pulling on the line, resulting in the fish pulling him into the waters and he went missing in the waters. Though the remaining three fishermen on board and other fishermen searched for Yerayya, their efforts proved futile. It is not the first time that such incidents were reported. A few such incidents were reported on the Vizag coast in the past. Such incidents are possible for a large fish to pull a fisherman into the sea. This usually happens when a powerful fish takes the bait and the fisherman is unable to manage the force of the fish pulling on the line, said Joint Director of Fisheries Department, Anakapalle district, G Vijaya. The search for the missing Yerayya is on, she added. It may be recalled fisherman Molli Joganna was impaled by a huge black marlin fish while he was fishing in the Bay of Bengal, off Andhra Pradeh’s Anakapalle coast in February 2022. The tragic incident occurred when Jogannawas attacked by the giant marlin, which is one of the most aggressive fishes known and has a spear-like snout. Joganna was a native of Mutyalammapalem coast in Anakapalle district A group of five fishermen on a traditional boat ventured into the Bay of Bengal for fishing (60 nautical miles from the shore). When the fishermen were lifting the net, they observed that the net was heavy, and they struggled to pull the net. Suspecting that something happened in the net, Joganna ventured into the waters to check. The marlin, which weighed around 80 kgs escaped from the net and pierced Joganna’s stomach with its sharp snout. Rescue efforts by the other fishermen failed and they brought Joganna’s body ashore. The fishermen said that the demand for the Marlin fish (Kommu Konam) is high in the market and at the same time a lot of risk is also while netting the Kommu Konam fish. Unlike other fishes, Marlin fish attack with its sharp snout. The fishermen also said the size of the fish ranges from 50 kgs to 150 kgs. EOM",

Directed by Krish and Jyothi Krisna, it stars Pawan Kalyan as the titular outlaw, Veera Mallu. The trailer was launched in numerous theatres across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with fans thronging to watch it on the big screen. But there’s one theatre that missed out. (Also Read: Hari Hara Veera Mallu trailer: Pawan Kalyan fights for dharma; to secure Koh-i-Noor from Bobby Deol's Aurangzeb. Watch ) Sandhya Theatre cancels HHVM trailer screening According to a report by 123Telugu, Sandhya Theatre at RTC X Roads in Hyderabad cancelled the screening of HHVM's trailer. After a massive group of fans lined up at the theatre on Wednesday evening to secure a pass for the trailer launch on Thursday morning, the theatre management had to call in police to control the crowd and prevent any unwanted tragedy. The report also posted a picture of a sign put up by the theatre management that reads, “Hari Hara Veera Mallu trailer cancelled.” The theatre management willingly decided to cancel the screening. The Pushpa 2 stampede incident In December last year, Allu Arjun visited Sandhya Theatre with his family for the premiere of Pushpa 2: The Rule. The actor left the show midway through after the police told him that the crowd was becoming uncontrollable. His visit sparked a stampede when fans rushed forward to meet him, leaving a woman dead and her young son hospitalised in a critical condition. The actor and the theatre management were arrested for negligence, and he was released on bail. He claimed he had police permission to visit, even as the police claimed otherwise. Arjun apologised for the mishap and paid for the boy’s treatment. About HHVM HHVM went on floors in 2020, so fans have been waiting for the film for a long time. It stars Pawan, Bobby Deol, and Nidhhi Agerwal in the lead roles. The film will be released in theatres on 24 July.",

He addressed the mango crisis in Chittoor, promising government intervention and subsidies for farmers.",
            "content": "TIRUPATI: Chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu accused the YSRCP of threatening their party worker Singaiah’s wife in a bid to corner the ruling party. “YSRCP has the dubious distinction of being renowned for its murder politics. It was very clear that when their own party worker Singaiah got crushed under the wheels of the vehicle of their party chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy, instead of taking him immediately to the hospital, they dumped his body on the roadside and left him to die”, Naidu lamented. Shifting his focus to the mango crisis in the state, particularly in Chittoor district, CM stated that he was scheduled to hold a meeting with all stakeholders concerned and assured that the state govt will resolve the issue and come to the rescue of the farmers. “We have set aside Rs.250 cr towards extending subsidies for the mango farmers. We have also sought the centre’s support on the issue”, CM asserted. “Unlike the previous govt, the NDA govt is committed for the upliftment of the farming community as is evident from our allocations to irrigation in the very first year of the NDA rule in the state. The govt has allocated Rs.3950 cr at one go for Handri-Neeva project alone to ensure every single acre of farmland in the Rayalaseema region of the state gets assured water supply”, Naidu asserted. Meanwhile, CM reiterated that the Banakacharla project in Andhra Pradesh will not harm anyone’s interests. “About 2000 TMC ft waters from the Godavari river are going waste into the Ocean for more than a century now. All that Andhra Pradesh is trying to do is to divert and store about 200 TMC ft waters to benefit the farmers of the state”, Naidu asserted and added that he never raised any objections to irrigation projects constructed by Telangana or any other state in the past.",

            "content": "Kuppam (Andhra Pradesh), July 3 (PTI) Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday reiterated that YSRCP leaders are 'attempting to manipulate' the widow of C Singayya, who recently allegedly fell under the wheel of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's convoy and died. Naidu's remarks come in the wake of Singayya's widow, Mary, expressing serious suspicion over the death of her husband and alleging that something would have happened in the ambulance. On June 18, YSRCP president Jagan Mohan Reddy visited Rentapalla village in Palnadu district to call on the family members of a party leader who had died by suicide a year ago due to alleged 'harassment by TDP leaders and police'. While the former CM was on his way to Rentapalla, a YSRCP supporter, Singayya, who came to see Jagan, allegedly fell under the wheels of a vehicle in the convoy at Etukuru Cross in Guntur district and later succumbed to the injuries, which led to the police booking the former CM and others over Singayya's death. Though police initially said that Singayya did not fall under a vehicle in Reddy's convoy, later, citing additional evidence, they said that he had indeed fallen under Reddy's vehicle, prompting them to book the opposition leader. \"YSRCP leaders are now threatening Singayya's grieving wife to politicise the tragedy, displaying insensitivity and exploiting personal loss for political gain,\" said Naidu, addressing a press conference in Kuppam. Naidu further claimed that YSRCP leaders engaging in \"rowdyism and reckless politics\" have become dangerous for the state. He said that the law will punish the guilty, whoever they are, said Naidu. Naidu alleged that Singayya was 'discarded like a stray dog' without a shred of humanity, condemning the YSRCP's alleged inaction and its 'dehumanising political culture'. The chief minister alleged that YSRCP leaders were now 'attempting to manipulate' the grief of Singayya's widow (Lourdu Mary) for political gain, calling it a shameful exploitation of personal tragedy. He accused the erstwhile YSRCP government of launching personal attacks, spreading lies about his role in YS Vivekananda Reddy's murder, and committing financial fraud amounting to economic terrorism. Naidu further alleged that YSRCP tampered with official land records, which caused a surge in public grievances. \"We are resolving these issues on priority,\" he said. He claimed Andhra Pradesh once had one of the country's best land record systems, which was allegedly dismantled under YSRCP rule, eroding trust and administrative efficiency. \"The YSRCP thrives on deception. Their lies are short-lived, but our development is lasting,\" he said, reaffirming his government's commitment to good governance. The TDP-led NDA government has allocated nearly Rs 250 crore as subsidy to support mango farmers facing procurement issues due to shifting demand in processing industries, Naidu told reporters. Naidu assured that discussions with farmers and procurement agencies are underway to resolve supply mismatches and stabilise mango cultivation across key regions like Rayalaseema. Naidu further clarified that the Polavaram-Banakacharla link project, which aims to channel excess Godavari water to the Rayalaseema region, causes no harm to anyone and dismissed fake news, reaffirming his commitment to cooperation on Godavari river irrigation initiatives. He emphasised that nearly 2,000 TMC of Godavari water flows unused into the sea yearly. Utilizing just 200 TMC would benefit both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana significantly. \"I have never opposed, nor will I oppose, any irrigation projects being constructed by Telangana over the Godavari river,\" said Naidu.

Utilizing just 200 TMC would benefit both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana significantly..\"I have never opposed, nor will I oppose, any irrigation projects being constructed by Telangana over the Godavari river,\" said Naidu.",

            "content": "The Telangana Crime Investigation Department (CID) has apprehended another accused in the inter-State human organ trafficking racket, that operated under the guise of legitimate organ donation and transplantation, at a private hospital in Hyderabad. Previously, 16 persons had been arrested in connection with the case. On July 1, CID officers from the Sangareddy unit arrested another suspect, identified as Kondagoni Murali Krishna, a resident of Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh. He was picked up by a special team in his hometown, and a BMW car was seized from his possession. Murali Krishna was brought to Hyderabad and produced before the magistrate the following day. According to investigators, the accused targeted vulnerable and financially poor individuals from Tamil Nadu, enticing them with false promises of employment. The victims were then trafficked to Hyderabad, where illegal kidney transplants were carried out with the help of accomplices, including individuals identified as Pradeep from Bengaluru, Pavan, and his associates. For each transplant, the accused is believed to have earned a commission of ₹10 lakh, out of which only ₹4 to ₹5 lakh was paid to the donor. The case came to light following a complaint from the Deputy District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) of Rangareddy district regarding illegal activities at Alakananda Multi Speciality Hospital, Kothapet, under the limits of Saroornagar Police Station. A case was registered under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994. The case was later transferred to the CID on April 24 for further investigation. CID officials say more arrests may follow as the investigation expands across State borders.",

The Congress MP said the decision was the result of persistent efforts by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy and Irrigation Minister N. Uttam Kumar Reddy to protect the State’s water interests. He criticised BRS MLA Harish Rao, saying that the BRS was trying to wriggle out of its predicament of offering Godavari waters to the then A.P. government after Chief Minister Revanth Reddy exposed the BRS’s lies. Mr. KCR’s statements and the BRS failures were exposed with evidence, and people were convinced how the BRS government mortgaged the State’s interests. Mr. Harish Rao is trying to rake up the Telangana sentiment, linking Chandrababu Naidu, forgetting that it was the BRS government that had actually offered Godavari waters to the Jaganmohan Reddy government.",

The video footage showed the security guard, whose identity is yet to be established, removing his uniform shirt and challenging the studio personnel to a fight, using abusive language. The situation soon escalated into a physical brawl, with both parties mutually raining blows. With the situation going out of control, the nearby shopkeepers intervened and pacified them.

            "content": "The Tamil Nadu police, on Tuesday, arrested Abubacker Siddique, 60, in Annamayya district, Andhra Pradesh, who was reportedly the kingpin of the bomb blast in front of the BJP head office in Malleswaram, Bengaluru, in 2013. He was absconding for over 30 years. The police said that he is a member of Al Umma, a Tamil Nadu-based organisation, which was banned after a pipe bomb attack on veteran BJP leader L.K. Advani in Coimbatore in 1998. On April 17, 2023, a time bomb placed on an old bike exploded in front of the BJP office, injuring a total of 17, including a college-going girl, who sustained severe injuries to her leg. The Central Crime Branch (CCB), Bengaluru city police, which investigated the case, unearthed a terror module allegedly put together by Abubacker Siddique from the remnants of Al Umma. The organisation was known to target only Hindutva activists, organisations and establishments. “The bike on which the time bomb was placed led us to a used bike dealer in Tamil Nadu, who gave the number of one of those who bought the said bike. The SIM card was also stolen. But using technical analysis, we made the first arrests, and their interrogation led us to unravel the entire module,” a senior police official involved in the probe into the blast recalled. Tamil Nadu police were probing a series of targeted murders of Hindutva activists in the State in 2013, when the bomb blast happened in front of the BJP office in Bengaluru. The same module busted by the city police turned out to be behind those cases as well. Following the initial arrests, including that of Kichan Buhari, one of the key conspirators, three other key accused in the case - Panna Ismail, Police Fakruddin and Bilal Mallik - were arrested after a fierce gun battle in which an accused and a police officer were injured in Puttur, Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh. Panna Ismail had parked the explosive-laden bike in front of the BJP office, the police said. “Their interrogation revealed that the leader of the module, who had put it together, was Abubacker Siddique, who had been on the run since 1995. Siddique was a shadowy figure, known to be very radicalised. There were many alarming reports about him. Some reports even suggested that it was linked to Al Qaeda and is said to have gone and fought in the Afghan war against American forces post 9/11. All efforts to nab him did not yield any results,” a senior police official from the State, who pursued the elusive terror operative for many years, said. Abubacker Siddique has been listed as an absconding accused in the BJP office blast case chargesheet. The officials said that the city police will shortly move the court to seek his custody in the case.",

He asked the accused to resolve the cases in National Lok Adalat to be held at Principal District and Sessions Court in Nellore on July 5. “Not only property tax evaders, but building owners and developers who have taken up unauthorised constructions and additional floors in violation of permits, must take advantage of this opportunity provided by the courts through National Lok Adalat and pay the dues, along with the penalty fee to get the cases dismissed,” he said. The Commissioner informed that payments can be made at the NMC Tax Collection Centre which will be set up on July 5 on the premises of the Principal District and Sessions Court. He further warned that the courts may impose imprisonment of up to three years for those who fail to pay the arrears, including the penalty fee.

            "content": "The YSR Congress Party (YSRPC) has accused the coalition government in Andhra Pradesh of harassing persons with disabilities and unjustly revoking their pension under the pretext of a re-verification drive. Addressing the media at the party office on Wednesday, the party’s president for the disabled wing Kiran Raj condemned the “discriminatory and inhumane policies,” and alleged that over one lakh individuals had lost their pension following the re-verification process. “How can those who have officially been recognised as disabled before the elections suddenly become non-disabled later?” he asked, branding the move arbitrary and politically motivated. Stating that the process had humiliated many, he cited instances where inadequate facilities at the verification centres resulted in severe hardship to the persons with disabilities. Taking a dig at the government for discontinuing several welfare schemes initiated by the YSRCP administration, including financial aid for marriages of disabled persons, he said the accusation that the previous government had issued disability certificates for profit were “defamatory and baseless.” Criticising Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan for failing to speak up for the disabled despite earlier pledges to stand against injustice, Mr. Kiran Raj said, “He (Mr. Pawan Kalyan) launched a party to question injustice, but today he is silent and unreachable.” He demanded a complete review of the re-verification process, immediate reinstatement of cancelled pensions, and compensation to those affected by the alleged negligence. “If this oppression continues, we will not remain silent. We will launch a Statewide movement to secure justice,” he said.",

            "content": "The National Hindu Dharmic Conference held here adopted resolutions aimed at “safeguarding and revitalising Hindu traditions and temple governance.” The conference, organised by Sadhu Parishad here on Wednesday (July 2), called for the immediate revocation of all controversial Government Orders (G.O.s) that adversely affect temple administration. It was strongly recommended that only religiously committed individuals (Dhārmikas) be appointed to temple trust boards to ensure faith-based leadership. One of the major proposals was to declare Tirupati as a spiritual city, alongside implementing a strict ban on alcohol and meat consumption within its limits. To preserve cultural integrity, the government was urged to extend full protection to Hindu festivals and religious processions. The conference, presided over by Srinivasananda Saraswati Swamiji, adopted another resolution emphasising the need to declare cow as India’s national animal and establish goshalas (cow shelters) in every village, preferably on temple land. In addition, barren land should be utilised exclusively for cultivating fodder for cows. Educational reforms were also highlighted, including a call to open new institutions under the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in every district. Moreover, the TTD was urged to run its own goshalas and to use ghee from those cows in the preparation of laddus, thereby maintaining spiritual purity and self-sufficiency. Additional proposals included government funding for ashram maintenance and the removal of government employees who converted after obtaining employment based on caste reservation. BJP State president P.V.N. Madhav emphasised the need to position Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) as a global spiritual beacon, saying that despite India’s immense spiritual wealth, over 80% of the world remains unaware of its dharmic depth. “India is poised to reclaim its ancient role as ‘Vishwaguru’, the spiritual guide of the world.” Citing the recent International Yoga Day celebrations in Visakhapatnam, where lakhs of participants chanted “Om” in unison, Mr. Madhav lauded the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in bringing dharmic consciousness back to the forefront of global discourse. Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) State president Vabilishetty Venkateshwarlu, VHP organisational secretary Ravi Kumar and others spoke.",

            "content": "An Infosys employee was arrested this week after he was allegedly caught recording explicit videos of female colleagues inside a women's restroom at the company’s Electronic City campus. The accused, Swapnil Nagesh Mali, 28, from Andhra Pradesh, worked as a senior associate consultant in the Helix department. The shocking incident occurred on June 30, when a female employee noticed a suspicious reflection on the restroom door while using the third-floor women’s facility. Upon further inspection, she discovered a man in the adjacent stall attempting to film her using a mobile phone from atop the commode. Startled, the woman screamed, prompting the accused to apologize immediately. She alerted nearby employees, and Infosys’ Human Resources (HR) department was quickly informed. Upon investigating Mali’s phone, HR personnel allegedly uncovered over 30 objectionable videos, including one of the complainant. Following the discovery, the victim’s husband confronted Infosys, criticizing the company’s initial response and demanding accountability. The female employee then lodged a formal complaint with the Electronic City police station on July 1. Police arrested Mali the same day based on her statement and digital evidence. He now faces serious charges under sections related to voyeurism, criminal breach of privacy, and sexual harassment under the Indian Penal Code and the IT Act. Infosys has yet to issue a detailed public statement on the matter. The case has ignited public outcry over workplace safety, privacy violations, and corporate responsibility, with many demanding stronger preventative measures and transparent handling of such incidents.

            "content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday (July 2, 2025) directed the State of Andhra Pradesh to submit, in a sealed cover, its inquiry report into an alleged illegal mining scam involving former Gannavaram MLA and YSR Congress Party leader Vallabhaneni Vamsi Mohan. The direction was issued by a Bench led by Justice M.M. Sundresh while hearing a petition filed by the State challenging a May 29 order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which had granted anticipatory bail to Mr. Mohan in connection with the case. Also read: A.P. Government constitutes SIT to investigate cases against former MLA Vallabhaneni Vamsi The Bench agreed to hear the State’s petition in detail on July 17. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the State, submitted that the government had not been granted a proper opportunity to present its case. He said Mr. Mohan was the “kingpin” of a “largescale mining scam” and that his custodial interrogation was necessary, citing allegations that he had threatened witnesses. When Justice Sundresh observed that the complaint appeared “barebones” and lacked material particulars, Mr. Luthra responded that the inquiry report prepared by the State’s Vigilance and Enforcement Department was exhaustive. The Bench then directed the State to place the report on record in a sealed cover. Also read: A.P. Police search for former MLA Vamsi’s mobile phone According to the State’s petition, the largescale illegal mining scam was uncovered through a comprehensive enquiry by the Vigilance and Enforcement Department. The illegal activities allegedly took place between 2019 and 2024 across Gannavaram, Bapulapadu, and Vijayawada Rural mandals. The State submitted that Mr. Mohan, during his tenure as MLA, had misused his office and conspired with associates to orchestrate a sophisticated racket involving the fraudulent procurement and misuse of temporary mining permits. The petition claimed that mining permits were obtained using forged documents, including PAN and Aadhaar details of unsuspecting civilians who had been misled into submitting their identity proofs under the pretext of enrollment in government welfare schemes. Further, legal procedures were allegedly bypassed to extract gravel and building stone, with complaints by local police and revenue authorities being suppressed due to Mr. Mohan’s political influence. “The total wrongful loss to the public exchequer due to these fraudulent mining activities has been calculated to be ₹195.04 crore,” the State’s petition noted.",

The CBI had registered the case on July 11, 2017 against Narasimham following allegations that while working as in-charge development officer by abusing his official position as a public servant demanded a bribe of Rs.10,000 from the complainant. The bribe was demanded to forward the insurance claim file relating to the death of complainant’s buffalo to the divisional office of UIIC in Guntur. The CBI laid a trap and the accused was caught red handed while demanding and accepting the bribe of Rs.10,000 from the complainant. After investigation, a charge-sheet was filed on October 27, 2017 against Narasimham. After trial, the court found the accused guilty and sentenced him accordingly.",

            "content": "HYDERABAD: Telangana lacks adequate political and administrative support for protection of wildlife and forests, particularly with reference to wildlife sanctuaries where there are largescale encroachments inside the forests, the Wildlife Institute of India has said. In particular, the WII flagged the case of the Pakhal and the Eturnagaram wildlife sanctuaries as examples where forest encroachments have turned into a serious issue and called for inter-departmental cooperation for encroachment removals and restoration of the degraded forest patches. In its Management Effectiveness Evaluation report for 2020-25, the WII said that around 52,000 hectares of forest, in the 860 sq. km Pakhal wildlife sanctuary in Warangal district — remain under encroachment. The sanctuary, the WII said, faces challenges from illegal livestock grazing, tree felling and poaching of wildlife, along with rampant forest fires. The report said that in addition to acute shortage of staff, and poor protection infrastructure, the “government subsidies for farm equipment, even for encroachers, exacerbate management difficulties.” The Pakhal sanctuary is home to leopard, sloth bear, nilgai, chital, jackal, langur and bonnet macaque, and a variety of other mammals and reptiles in addition to a large number of bird species. With respect to the Eturnagaram sanctuary in Mulugu district, the WII said protection efforts of this sanctuary in particular, suffer from lack of support — both political and administrative – especially with respect to encroachments. As per WII, the Eturnagaram sanctuary has problems related to livestock grazing, illegal hunting, tree felling, and unauthorised cultivation. Noting its history of left-wing extremism, the WII said this sanctuary has 32 settlements of the Gottikoya tribes, who cause “heavy biotic disturbance” and that in addition to this issue, pockets of encroachments by local villagers leads to conflicts related to forest protection activities, with tribal groups, “many of whom enter from neighbouring states.” The government and its various departments should work together to remove the encroachments, particularly those occupied by the Guttikoya tribals by providing them with attractive rehabilitation packages. Both sanctuaries, the report said, have been reporting the presence of tigers over the past few years, and called for better management plans, as Eturnagaram and Pakhal serve as connecting forest areas for big cat movement as these two sanctuaries form part of an important forest connecting Bijapur forests in Chhattisgarh through Pakhala and Papikonda national park in Andhra Pradesh’s Alluri Sitaramaraju and Eluru districts all the way to the Tadoba tiger reserve in Maharashtra.",

But some sons who have grown up on the hardship of parents' wings are becoming a headache for them. The latest news has come to light in the NTR district. A father who was tired of his son's behavior for alcohol was finally to behed away. According to the police, the son of Golla Krishna from the village of Sher Mohammed Peeta, Jaggayapet Mandalam, NTR district, has a son named Venkata Narayana. Father Krishnakumar's son was hard to raise and he was an adult. Five years ago, a woman named Krishnakumari married him and made a housewife. For years, Venkata Narayana and Krishnakumari had a son and a daughter. However, Venkata Narayana has been addicted to drinking for some time. He drank daily and started to cause serious trouble with his wife and wife at home. The wife, who was unable to bear her husband's behavior, left him five years ago. The wife left. But the parents cannot leave it. However, after the wife left, Venkata Narayana's behavior became even more stubborn. Drinking day by day, hitting the talismans turned into a routine. Venkata Narayana did not care about how many parents told them not to beat themselves. Once again, on Monday night, he drank home and clashed with his parents indiscriminately.

Chandrasekhar Reddy has condemned the ongoing transfers of government employees, alleging widespread irregularities and systemic mismanagement in the process. The transfer process, particularly for village and ward secretariat staff, is marred by egregious violations of rules, with over 90% of transfers reportedly influenced by undue pressures. Employees are being forcibly relocated to areas far from their home mandals, causing severe disruption and distress, he alleged. In a statement on Monday, the YSRCP leader demanded immediate action, and cancellation of all irregular transfers and the initiation of a transparent, well-planned transfer process. He urged the government to release four pending DAs without delay. “If the government continues to exploit employees, it will not survive long,” he warned. Mr. Chandrasekhar alleged that the transfers were undermining the system with arbitrary decisions under the guise of rationalisation. “The transfers are being done based on recommendations from MLAs, with employees being coerced into or paying bribes to secure postings. Why are MLA recommendation letters being demanded when no such requirement exists in the transfer G.O.s?” he asked. The YSRCP leader said this practice has left employees, particularly women, vulnerable to harassment, with ‘counselling sessions conducted at odd hours’, adding to their plight. Many employees are struggling to meet the financial demands of MLAs and their associates, plunging them into further hardship.",

Both the officials assured that efforts are under way to credit the pending payments to farmers’ accounts within a week. On the occasion, association State general secretary P. Jamalayya criticised the State government for failing to fulfill its initial promise of crediting payments within 24 hours of procurement. While initial payments were made to few farmers within 24 to 48 hours, no further payments have been made since May 10, he said, adding that the delay is unjust and detrimental to farmers’ livelihoods. Mr. Jamalayya also raised concerns over the massive backlog of payments owed to farmers across several districts in Andhra Pradesh. According to a district-wise data shared by him, the total dues add up to a staggering ₹993 crore. Detailing the backlog, Mr. Jamalayya revealed that West Godavari tops the list, with the government yet to clear ₹296 crore. This is followed by Konaseema with ₹256 crore, Kakinada with ₹141 crore, and East Godavari with ₹131 crore. Other districts facing significant delays include Eluru (₹89 crore), NTR district (₹36 crore), Bapatla (₹26 crore), and Krishna (₹12 crore). Prakasam and Tirupati districts have comparatively smaller amounts pending, with ₹3 crore each, he said. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham vice-president Malneedi Yellamandar Rao expressed deep concern over the plight of farmers in NTR district. He pointed out that in Mulpadu village under Ibrahimpatnam mandal, dues amounting to ₹75 lakh are still pending. Similarly ₹75 lakh is yet to be released in Paidurupadu village of Vijayawada mandal. In Nunnavaram, farmers await ₹65 lakh, while those in Kavuluru under G. Konduru mandal are yet to receive ₹70 lakh. Recalling the grim situation from last year, Mr. Yellamandar Rao said that many tenant farmers suffered devastating crop losses during the Kharif floods. Despite setbacks, they worked hard to cultivate paddy during the Rabi season, hoping to recover some of their losses. However, their hopes were dashed when payments stopped abruptly after initial disbursements. Joining the appeal, NTR district president of the Tenant Farmers’ Association, Buddi Ramesh, urged the government to act without delay.",

            "content": "Eluru District Collector K. Vetri Selvi instructed officials from the Medical and Health Department to intensify public awareness on dengue symptoms and preventive measures. She emphasised the importance of educating people during the National Dengue Awareness month. The Collector, on Monday, unveiled awareness posters and banners on dengue, printed by the Health Department. She called for collective action to prevent the spread of dengue, particularly by ensuring cleanliness in surroundings and avoiding water stagnation. The Collector directed ASHA workers and health staff to form three teams and conduct house visits to raise awareness on mosquito breeding and its dangers. “If mosquito larvae are eliminated, dengue can largely be controlled,” she said, asking staff to demonstrate it visually to the public. She also instructed the Panchayati Raj and Municipal officials to carry out anti-larval operations and fogging activities on a regular basis. Stating that Aedes mosquitoes spread dengue, she said that they breed in stagnant clean water found in uncovered containers such as drums, barrels, flower pots, and unused vessels. These can often be found inside and outside homes, especially during the rainy season. She urged people to clean such containers weekly, cover them properly, and use engine oil or mud to seal rainwater-collecting spots. Additionally, she suggested placing a sponge or a cloth in refrigerator trays and squeezing them weekly to avoid mosquito breeding. “Mosquitoes that spread dengue bite during daytime, so people must be cautious while cleaning their homes,” she added. Joint Collector P. Dhatri Reddy, DCHS Paul Satish Kumar, District Medical and Health Officer R. Malini, District Malaria Officer P.S. Prasad, Aarogyasri District Coordinator Rajeev, DRDA PD R. Vijayaraju, Special Deputy Collector K. Bhaskar, and others attended the event.",

            "content": "The Kadapa district administration has joined hands with the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad, under the Enabling Agricultural Nutrition Convergence through Technical Support (ENACTS) project, to make nutrient-rich food more accessible and sustainable in rural areas. The ENACTS project is funded by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The study by the ISB’s Bharti Institute of Public Policy has embarked on a mission to research the current food production and identify ways to make it more nutrition-focused. The early phase of the project will concentrate on the challenges faced by the rural households, such as poor nutrition, limited market access and low food production. Kadapa District Collector Sreedhar Cherukuri said that the study would help design programmes to improve the health of undernourished families. “The project will also explore digital nutrition e-vouchers for high-risk groups. These vouchers can be used at specific stores to balance food supply and demand, though the exact plan is still being worked out”, he added. The Collector said two focus areas are C.K. Dinne and Jammalamadugu Rural mandals, which are also part of the national aspirational districts programme with the NITI Aayog. The study will look at ways to increase the production and consumption of nutritious foods, including encouraging the intake of eggs and promoting kitchen gardens. There is also a proposal in the form of horticulture intervention, which aims to strengthen links between farmers, markets and the public to make nutrient-rich food more accessible and sustainable. The project also looks at global market opportunities and crop optimisation. The ISB’s Bharti Institute of Public Policy will continue to support Kadapa district administration’s efforts to become a model district for nutrition and horticultural innovation, a release said.",

            "content": "Yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s proposed plan for yoga and naturopathy initiatives at Horsley Hills near Madanapalle of Annamayya district triggered a strong opposition from various sectors of the society. Local leaders from the Communist Party of India (CPI), Congress Party, and public groups staged protests on Monday and demanded that the State government withdraw its “reported plans to hand over Horsely Hills” to Baba Ramdev and his team in the name of a wellness centre. The yoga guru had visited the Horsley Hills on June 26, along with a team from Patanjali Yogpeeth, reportedly to explore the feasibility of establishing a global yoga and wellness centre. According to a senior official who accompanied the team, Ramdev inspected a piece of land close to a government guest house and expressed his plans to commission yoga and naturopathy initiatives there. He was also reportedly impressed with the serene landscape, clean air, and cool weather, terming them “ideal for spiritual healing”. The yoga guru’s visit to the State close on the heels of the recently-concluded month-long Yogandhra-2025 campaign, which culminated in Visakhapatnam on June 21 in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has also raised doubts about the TDP-led government’s plans. A team led by the CPI Annamayya district unit visited the hill station to take stock of the situation on Monday (June 30). Speaking to the media, CPI State Secretariat Member Gujjala Eeswaraiah said that the allocation of public and forest land to a private organisation would amount to clear violation of the laws of environment protection. “This could lead to deforestation, threaten wildlife habitats, and lead to the evacuation of the local tribal communities from atop the hills and foothills,” he said, adding that the issue would be elaborately discussed in the ensuing Annamayya district CPI Mahasabhalu scheduled in Madanapalle on August 11 and 12. In order to protect the fragile ecosystem of the Horsley Hills and its vibrancy as a popular tourism destination, the CPI also launched “One Lakh Signatures Campaign” to stall the move in favour of Baba Ramdev.",

            "content": "Hyderabad: The BJP central leadership is just a step away from making a formal announcement regarding the appointment of new party chiefs for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. On Monday, only one nomination was received for each state's leadership position. In Telangana, former MLC N Ramachander Rao emerged as the sole nominee, while in Andhra Pradesh, former MLC PVN Madhav filed the only nomination. While notification for the polling to elect state chiefs was issued on Sunday, nominations and withdrawals were to take place on Monday. If there were multiple nominations, the polling was to be held on Tuesday.The party's central leadership ensured that only those \"picked\" candidates filed their papers, paving the way for unanimous declarations. The formal announcement is expected on Tuesday morning..'Samajwaad' cover for 'Namazwaad': BJP slams RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav's stand on Waqf Act .Both leaders share strong RSS backgrounds and have their political roots in ABVP student politics. The race for the Telangana BJP chief position initially saw interest from MPs Eetala Rajender and Dharmapuri Arvind, given their Backward Classes background and the BJP central leadership's previous commitment to appoint a BC leader as chief minister if the party comes to power in the state. Rajender is also a recent entrant into the saffron party from BRS.However, sources within the BJP told DH that Ramachander Rao, a Brahmin, emerged as a consensus candidate amid the various factions within the Telangana party unit. The sources also revealed that Rao's tenure as state BJP chief will conclude sometime before the next assembly elections, at which point the party plans to select a BC leader to helm the state unit and lead the electoral campaign.In Andhra Pradesh, Madhav will succeed Rajahmundry MP and TDP founder N T Rama Rao's daughter, Daggubati Purandeswari, as the state BJP chief, marking a significant leadership transition in the coastal state. Since BJP's both allies in Andhra Pradesh—TDP and Jana Sena—are led by upper caste leaders, the saffron party decided to go with BC leader Madhav, who is a second-generation BJP leader.Madhav's father, PV Chalapathi Rao, was a Jan Sangh veteran who later worked hard to strengthen BJP in coastal Andhra Pradesh. Chalapathi Rao also served as the BJP state unit chief in the past..V P Ramalingam elected unopposed as BJP Puducherry chief.The appointment of both leaders reflects the party's strategy of selecting candidates with strong organizational backgrounds and the ability to unite different factions within their respective state units.The choice of Ramachander Rao ignited mild controversy as Ghoshamahal MLA T Raja Singh Lodh resigned from the party, claiming someone had misled the party leadership about Ramachander Rao. Raja Singh had also aspired to become party state unit chief and wanted to file his nomination on Monday.\"I went to file my nomination and even took the application form. National Council members threatened me not to give their support. They warned me, asking whether I should remain in the party (BJP) or be suspended. Three members signed my application, but I still needed signatures from seven more members. Due to this, I couldn't file the nomination. So I gave a resignation letter to Kishan Reddy and requested him to approve it. I told Kishan Reddy to inform the assembly Speaker that Raja Singh is not their MLA and should suspend him,\" said Raja Singh.In his resignation letter, Raja Singh said the decision to pick Rao came as a shock and disappointment, not just to him, but to lakhs of party workers, leaders, and voters who have stood by the party through every high and low.\"At a time when BJP stands at the threshold of forming its first government in Telangana, such a choice raises serious doubts about the direction we are heading. There are many capable senior leaders, MLAs, and MPs within our state who have tirelessly worked for the growth of BJP and who have the strength, credibility, and connect to lead the party forward. Unfortunately, it appears that some individuals, driven by personal interests, have misled the central leadership and taken decisions by running the show from behind the curtain. This not only undermines the sacrifices of grassroot workers but risks pushing the party into avoidable setbacks,\" said Raja Singh.",

            "content": "HYDERABAD: Prime accused in the murder of private land surveyor G Tejeshwar, Thirumala Rao, was arrested by a special police team from his hideout in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh in the early hours of Wednesday. Rao, manager of an NBFC branch in Kurnool, was aided by his father, a retired cop, in securing shelter with a family linked to factionism. The assailants reportedly made 15 attempts earlier to eliminate Tejeshwar, but finally succeeded in executing their plan on June 17. Rao tried to not execute murder plan immediately You Can Also Check: Hyderabad AQI | Weather in Hyderabad | Bank Holidays in Hyderabad | Public Holidays in Hyderabad During interrogation, Thirumala Rao confessed that he was aware of the Meghalaya honeymoon murder case and tried to dissuade his alleged lover, Sahasra alias Ishwarya, from executing the plan immediately since the case was still fresh in public memory After Tejeshwar's murder on June 17, Thirumala Rao had obtained two personal loans for 20 lakh and planned to go to Ladakh in J&K with Ishwarya. However, as the police probe picked up pace, he reached Hyderabad seeking help from a relative in Khairatabad. Unable to get any help, Thirumala Rao's father, Tirupataiah, a retired assistant sub-inspector of AP Special Police, picked him up from Hyderabad and drove him to a contact in Kadapa with links to factionism. Tirupataiah dropped his son in Kadapa and returned to Kurnool. \"He instructed his son not to use any electronic gadgets to contact outsiders,\" the Gadwal police said. Thirumala Rao's family members were questioned, but Tirupataiah remained non-cooperative and misleading. When senior officers interrogated him, Tirupataiah revealed location of his son.

This caused a rift between Tejeshwar and Ishwarya. Initially, Thirumala Rao and Ishwarya wanted to eliminate the former's wife, but later they focused on Tejeshwar. After Thirumala Rao roped in three loan seekers, Nagesh, Parashuram, and Raju of Kurnool, to kill Tejeshwar, 15 attempts were made to eliminate him. However, the accused called off the attempts at the last minute since they were not comfortable killing the surveyor in an open area when he was on a bike,\" an investigator said. Rao confessed that Ishwarya became restless with the delay and even volunteered to bring her husband on a bike towards Kurnool so that the killers could intercept them and execute the murder. However, the killers wanted to execute murder in a car, and they succeeded when Tejeshwar agreed to accompany them to survey a land parcel on June 17.",

            "content": "Weeks after Raja Raghuvanshi's chilling murder on his honeymoon in Meghalaya, a similar incident came to light in Andhra Pradesh. In a case of a crime driven by an extramarital affair, a 32-year-old man from Telangana was allegedly murdered by his wife and her lover in Andhra Pradesh. His body was later found dumped in a canal. G Tejeshwar, a land surveyor and part-time dancer from Gadwal, was found dead days after he went missing. According to police officials, he was murdered by three contract killers hired by his wife’s lover, The Economic Times reported. Eight people have been arrested so far across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in this matter. What happened? Tejeshwar married T Sahasra alias Ishwarya, 25, on May 17 at Anjaneya Temple in Beechupalli against the wishes of his parents. He left his house in Gadwal on the evening of June 17 and never returned. The next day, his brother, Tejvardhan, reported him missing to the Gadwal town police. Gadwal Superintendent of Police T Srinivasa Rao said, “We verified CCTV footage at different places and found that Tejeshwar got into a car on June 17. Our teams located the decomposed body in the HNSS Canal in Sugalimetta under the Panyam police station limits of Nandyal district (AP) on June 21. Family members of the victim identified the body.\" According to investigations, the three - Nagesh, Parashuram, and Raju - approached Thirumala Rao, a non-banking finance company (NBFC) manager in Kurnool, to obtain a loan. According to police, Rao persuaded them to carry out the murder. “The three said Thirumala Rao convinced them to kill Tejeshwar. On June 17, they picked up Tejeshwar from Gadwal on the pretext of carrying out a land survey at Yerravalli in Gadwal. They killed him by slitting his throat in the car,” a Gadwal police officer was quoted as saying by The Economic Times. Rao was shown the body before it was placed into the HNSS canal. Rao allegedly paid the killers ₹2 lakh. The Swift Dzire used in the murder was eventually recovered in Panyam. According to Jogulamba Gadwal district Superintendent of Police T Srinivas Rao, Aishwarya was in frequent contact with Rao and exchanged over 2,000 phone conversations with him from February to June. “Even on her wedding day, she was constantly on the phone. Her in-laws questioned this, but she claimed she was speaking to her mother,” SP Srinivas Rao told NDTV. “The plan was to bury him in a layout under the guise of land surveying. But due to unexpected people at the spot, they decided to throw the body in a canal. However, the canal had very little water,” SP Srinivas Rao added. Rao, who had been married for eight years and had no children, reportedly considered killing his wife. He is also thought to have had an affair with Ishwarya's mother, Sujatha, who worked as a sweeper at his bank. During her mother's absence, Ishwarya filled in at work, and her relationship with Rao grew. Sujatha, who is claimed to have opposed the affair and pressed Ishwarya into marrying Tejeswar, has also been detained for her involvement in the plan. Rao's father, a retired head policeman, was also detained for attempting to protect his son from the police. The latest incident has sparked widespread comparisons to the case of Indore businessman Raja Raghuvanshi , who was killed by his wife, Sonam, and her lover while on honeymoon in Meghalaya.",

            "content": "Amaravati, Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday accused the TDP-led NDA government of lacking fiscal discipline and exceeding 50 per cent of the borrowings incurred by the previous YSRCP regime in just 13 months. Reddy said that the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation concluded the second tranche of its NCD issuance at a coupon rate of 9.3 per cent on June 25 to raise ₹ 5,526 crore, taking the aggregate value of the issuance to ₹ 9,000 crore. \"With this NCD issuance, the total budget and off-budget borrowings availed and secured in this 13-month period by the TDP alliance government exceeded 50 per cent of what was borrowed by previous government over a 5 year period,\" said Reddy in a post on 'X'. Alleging that the N Chandrababu Naidu-led government disregards constitutional framework, the YSRCP supremo said MDC went for the second tranche of its NCD issuance despite this matter being admitted in the Andhra Pradesh High Court and notices served over it. \"Further, it is quite apparent that the proceeds of the issuance would be utilised for financing government revenue expenditure,\" he said. \"With total disregard to the constitutional provisions and in an unprecedented manner,\" Reddy alleged that the NDA alliance government granted private parties access to the consolidated fund of the state through RBI direct debit mandate. Owing to this arrangement, the opposition leader claimed that private parties \"can access the state exchequer and withdraw funds without any requirement of any action from the state government officials.\" According to Reddy, this is a blatant violation of Articles 203, 204 and 293 of the Constitution of India. Further, he said the southern state has also mortgaged mineral wealth, which is government property, worth ₹ 1.91 lakh crore for the NCD issuances of aggregate value ₹ 9,000 crore as additional security, terming it \"unheard of\". \"With such permission to access the state consolidated fund and mortgaging of government property of disproportionately huge value,\" Reddy said one would imagine that these bonds are even more secure than the SDLs issued by the state government. Further, he alleged that the MDC NCDs were issued at a coupon rate as high as 9.3 per cent, which is \"2.60 per cent higher than the prevailing SDL rate\". Reddy alleged that due to the high interest rate, the additional yearly burden on MDC is to the tune of ₹ 235 crore and the term of NCDs is understood to be 10 years. \"Can Naidu Garu answer as to who pocketed this?\" asked Reddy. Meanwhile, there was no immediate reaction from the TDP. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",

            "content": "Aishwarya and Tirumal Rao planned to kill Tejeswar like the Raja Raghuvanshi honeymoon murder case Aishwarya had a GPS installed on Tejeswar’s bike to track him for the planned murder Eight people, including Aishwarya, Tirumal Rao and her mother, have been arrested in the case In a shocking revelation in the probe into a Telangana man's murder a month after his wedding, police have found that Tejeswar's wife Aishwarya and her lover Tirumal Rao discussed the Raja Raghuvanshi honeymoon killing in Meghalaya and considered making a similar plan to eliminate Tejeswar and keep the cops guessing. According to Gadwal police chief T Srinivasa Rao, Aishwarya and Tirumal Rao have told them during questioning that they had initially planned to kill Tejeswar in the same manner as Raja Raghuvanshi. The plan was simple: Aishwarya would convince Tejeswar to take her out on a bike. On the way, the hired killers would attack them. Tejeswar would be murdered and Aishwarya would flee with Tirumal Rao. The cops, they thought, would be confused and chase a murder-cum-kidnapping angle. This is exactly how the Raja Raghuvanshi case played out, where Raja's body was found and his wife, Sonam, remained missing for days before police eventually unearthed her role in the conspiracy. Aishwarya and Tirumal Rao, however, have said they discussed the plan but later shelved it and considered other options. Police have also found that 23-year-old Aishwarya got her neighbour Jagan to install a GPS device on her husband's bike so that he could be tracked and murdered when the opportunity arose, the cops have found. A total of eight people, including Aishwarya, Tirumal Rao and her mother Sujatha, have been arrested in the case. Tejeshwar's rotten body was found in a field at Panyam in Andhra Pradesh's Nandyal district on June 20, two days after his family in Telangana's Gadwal reported that he was missing. The family suspected his newly-wed wife Aishwarya's involvement in the killing. As police from the two adjoining states got to work, the probe revealed a grisly crime that snuffed out an unsuspecting young man's life. According to the officials part of the probe, there were as many as five failed attempts on Tejeswar's life and he survived all, till luck ran out and he ended up dead in a canal. A Mother-Daughter Love Triangle Cops have found that Aishwarya's mother, Sujatha, worked as a sweeper at a Non-Banking Financial Company. There, she met an officer, Tirumal Rao, and the two started a relationship. Later, when Sujatha went on leave, Aishwarya replaced her. She, too, had a relationship with Rao. The bank officer was married and police found that he had also planned to get his wife killed. When Sujatha found that her daughter was involved with Rao, she pressured her to end the relationship and marry Tejeshwar, whom she had known for a while. Aishwarya refused. Sujatha managed to bring her around and reached out to Tejeswar. A wedding date was fixed, but Aishwarya went missing. Then she returned and told Tejeswar that she was incognito because her mother does not have the money to pay dowry. She insisted that she wanted to marry him. Tejeswar's family advised him against this, but he agreed to the May 18 wedding. The Plan -- And The Murder Tejeswar's family members have said she was constantly on the phone with Rao, even during her wedding. Her call records revealed that they exchanged over 2,000 phone calls between February and June. Rao, police said, found the killers to eliminate Tejeswar. Three people had approached him for clearing loans, and he told them they would get the loan -- and some more money -- if they completed the hit job. A police officer showed CCTV footage of Tejeswar, who worked as a land surveyor and dance teacher, getting into a car. \"The killers took him in a car on the pretext of surveying a land. He was on the seat beside the driver when they slit his throat and subsequently stabbed him in the stomach,\" said Gadwal police chief T Srinivasa Rao. The killers, police said, showed the body to Tirumal Rao over the phone and then disposed of it in the canal. \"The plan was to bury him in the layout of a land they had gone to survey in Kurnool, but noticing some people there, they dumped it in a canal. But there wasn't enough water in it. We used cell phone signals to track Tejeswar's location. By the time we found the body, it was putrefied. A tattoo on his arm saying 'amma' in Telugu helped us identify the body,\" said the district police chief. Escape Plan That Did Not Work Rao and Aishwarya had hoped that Tejeswar's body would not be found and he would be reported missing. They also had an escape plan. According to reports, Rao had taken a Rs 20-lakh loan and booked tickets for himself and Aishwarya to flee to Ladakh. Even after Tejeswar was killed, Aishwarya stayed at her in-laws' home, ostensibly to avoid raising suspicion. This did not work. As soon as Tejeswar went missing, his family approached the police and shared their suspicions about Aishwarya and Rao. As Gadwal cops worked overtime to trace Tejeswar's whereabouts, they got a tip-off from police at Kurnool in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh that villagers had found a body in an agricultural field. The Telangana cops rushed to the spot and confirmed it was Tejeswar's. Rao's father, a retired cop, allegedly tried to protect his son from the police, but no avail.

Similarly, in Meghalaya, a newlywed was murdered on his honeymoon, with his wife accused of paying her lover to orchestrate the killing.",
            "content": "NEW DELHI: In a disturbing parallel to two separate cases of spousal betrayal and murder, love turned lethal not once—but twice. In Telangana, a newlywed land surveyor was brutally killed, allegedly at the behest of his wife’s lover. Just weeks earlier, in Meghalaya, a young man on his honeymoon met a similar fate—murdered in cold blood after his wife allegedly paid her lover and his accomplices to track and kill him. Gadwal murder: Wife shared location, lover paid killers Rs 2 lakh You Can Also Check: Hyderabad AQI | Weather in Hyderabad | Bank Holidays in Hyderabad | Public Holidays in Hyderabad G Tejeshwar, a resident of Rajaveedhi in Gadwal town, Telangana, married T Sahasra alias Ishwarya (25) from Kallur in Andhra Pradesh on May 18, despite objections from his family. The couple had earlier cancelled their wedding in February after Ishwarya vanished for a few days. She returned and convinced Tejeshwar that she had left due to financial stress in her family. Believing her, Tejeshwar went ahead with the marriage, but tensions arose soon after. He reportedly grew suspicious of her constant phone conversations with an unknown person. On June 17, Tejeshwar left home after getting into a car for what he thought was a routine land survey, but never returned. Following a missing person complaint filed by his brother, police traced his last known movements through CCTV footage and found his decomposed body in the HNSS canal in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, on June 21. Police arrested three contract killers — Nagesh, Parashuram, and Raju — all from Kurnool, along with Ishwarya. The killers confessed they were paid Rs 2 lakh by Thirumala Rao, a Kurnool-based NBFC manager who had earlier been in a relationship with Ishwarya’s mother. Police said Rao had developed a relationship with Ishwarya as well, and she was fully aware of the plot to kill her husband. In fact, she even shared Tejeshwar’s location with the accused. On the pretext of conducting a land survey, the killers slit Tejeshwar’s throat in a car. After confirming the murder, Rao paid them the agreed amount. Initially, the plan was to bury the body on Rao’s land in Panyam, but they eventually dumped it in a canal. The murder vehicle, a Swift Dzire, has been recovered. Honeymoon murder: Wife paid Rs 50,000 for tracking and killing husband Miles away in the hills of Shillong, another deadly plot was unfolding—this time, with a honeymoon as the cover. Sonam Raghuvanshi from Madhya Pradesh is accused of paying Rs 50,000 to her lover, Raj Kushwaha, and his associates to stalk and kill her husband, Raja Raghuvanshi. According to investigators, Raj Kushwaha, along with Vishal Singh, Anand Kurmi, and Akash Rajput, travelled from Indore to Delhi between May 17 and 18, and then boarded the Rajdhani Express to Guwahati. From there, they entered Shillong and began monitoring Sonam and Raja’s movements. Police believe Sonam shared details of her travel plans, enabling the killers to execute their plan during the honeymoon. Authorities are probing the full extent of her involvement, including phone and financial records, to establish premeditation and conspiracy.",

            "content": "On June 25, 1975, late in the night, India’s then-Home Minister Kasu Brahmananda Reddy meet with then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at her official residence. Reddy penned down the details of an earlier meeting with the PM and then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. Reddy attached a draft proclamation, which Ahmed signed. By midnight, India was officially in a state of Emergency. Less than an hour to begin a 21-months period in history that the country may never forget. In the 21 months that India was under Emergency in 1975-76, the government ordered incarceration of opposition politicians, journalists, and activists. The Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) was enforced and allowed for incarceration without trial. Forced sterilisation and squashing of dissent are some of the horror stories from that period. But some parts of India were more hard hit than others. June 1975 was one such place. On June 22, 1975, Gandhi, through her personal secretary RK Dhawan, summoned then-Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister J. Vengal Rao. AP saw 1135 detainees under MISA, 45 under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA), and 451 under the Defence and Internal Security of India Rules (DISIR), noted the Shah Commission , charged with investigating excesses during the Emergency. The Commission's report showed that anyone not in with the Gandhi-government was against it and that this was not limited to politicians. Of the over 500 detainees, members of banned organisations (including 350 from the CPML), only 210 were political prisoners. The remaining were classified as “criminals” or “anti-social elements.” Speaking on the 50 th anniversary of what is considered one of the darkest eras of Indian politics, on June 25, 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that this time was one where the then-ruling party, the Indian National Congress , Indira Gandhi’s party, put “democracy under arrest.” Calling the 1975 Emergency as a \"prime example of their (Congress’s) shenanigans\", Modi added that no Indian will forget how spirit of the Constitution was violated during that time. However, Modi’s words come at a time when all opposition parties are united and calling his government’s 11-year-long rule as a “systematic and dangerous” assault on “Indian democracy” an “Undeclared Emergency.” Jairam Ramesh, the Congress general secretary in-charge communications, has said that in the past 11 years, critics of the government have been vilified as anti-nationals, and that the ruling party has deliberately spread hate and bigotry among the populous. In its October 1, 2024 issue Emergency The Legacy/The Lunacy , Outlook’s editor Chinki Sinha had alluded to the same issue—How different are the stories from those days of Emergency compared to the ones now? , she had asked . Senior journalist Harish Khare had written on the lessons the Indian politico and citizens could stand to learn from the Emergency era. “No ruler can be granted a carte blanche, like it happened during the Emergency, but the fact remains that we also learnt some valuable lessons during this period,” he wrote, adding that “even after nearly 50 years, we are nowhere near any understanding of the nature of the breakdown of normal politics that led to that midnight denouement on June 25, 1975.” Indian historian and novelist Mukul Kesavan wrote about growing up under the shadow of the Emergency. Indira Gandhi’s Gandhi’s principal legacy remains the systematic replacement of institutional governance with the vicious precedents of personalised rule, he wrote. Former editor and political analyst R Balashankar recalls the midnight knock that so many Indians over the age of 65 remember as iconic to the Emergency period. “A large percentage of Indians who are below the age of 65 may not have witnessed the midnight knock that had doused the flame of democracy in India 49 years ago.\" He added that \"was the most draconian step taken by any prime minister who was shown to the office by the Constitution.”",

A brief scuffle with police occurred during the dharna, but was quickly defused after District Collector J Venkata Murali and SP Tushar Dudi invited fishermen representatives for talks. The Collector assured that rocks blocking the canal mouth would be removed immediately and fishing routes restored. He announced the withdrawal of police cases against protestors and promised criminal action against those who dumped rocks illegally, obstructing the canal’s flow. Over 20,000 families using 2,500 boats have reportedly been affected. The disruption was traced to an individual who diverted 500 tonnes of sand to reroute the canal, causing severe boat damage and access issues. A special committee with officials from multiple departments and fishermen representatives will investigate the issue. A field-level report is expected within a month. Any illegal encroachments found will be dealt with under the CRZ Act. Dudi confirmed police cooperation in restoring routes.

            "content": "VIJAYAWADA: YSRCP president and former Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy slammed the TDP-led NDA government for betraying unemployed youth and students. In a post on X, he praised participants of the YSRCP-organised statewide ‘Yuvatha Poru’, commending their efforts to highlight the government’s failure to deliver on election promises. Jagan expressed outrage over the police lathi-charge on peacefully protesting students in Narasaraopet, questioning the coalition’s violent response to youth submitting a representation to the District Collector. Recalling the TDP’s election promise of Rs 3,000 monthly allowance for the unemployed, he said it remains unfulfilled even after one year. He also criticised the coalition for neglecting education schemes. He highlighted that Rs 4,200 crore in fee reimbursement under Jagananna Vidya Deevena remains pending across six quarters from January 2024 to June 2025, with only Rs 750 crore released. Similarly, Rs 2,200 crore is due under the Vasathi Deevena for two instalments. This Rs 6,400 crore shortfall has forced many students to abandon education for work, he said. Jagan accused Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu of suppressing dissent instead of fulfilling commitments, labelling the Narasaraopet lathi-charge as evidence of the NDA’s oppressive ‘Red Book’ governance.",

Justice N Harinath stayed proceedings against senior YSRCP leader Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, who faced a case filed by Thullur police over comments on Amaravati. The case stemmed from a complaint by Kambhampati Sireesha of Rayapudi village in Guntur district, following Sajjala’s remarks in response to journalist VVR Krishnam Raju’s comments. Reddy’s counsel S Dushyant Reddy argued that the case was politically motivated, and the charges were inapplicable. The court ordered a halt to further action pending review. In a separate case, Justice Y Lakshmana Rao stayed proceedings against former Raptadu MLA Thopudurthi Prakash Reddy. The case arose after police, citing a complaint by constable Mallikarjuna, alleged that YSRCP leaders, including Prakash Reddy, obstructed him from doing duties during a visit to console a minor victim’s family in Peruru. Prakash Reddy’s counsel Subrahmanya Sriram and M Balakrishna argued that the case was baseless and intended to harass the former MLA. The court directed police to file a counter, and adjourned the hearing for three weeks.",

            "content": "VIJAYAWADA: In a major push to boost employment, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has directed officials to prioritise skill development programmes with a clear target of creating 20 lakh jobs for youth. He emphasised that skill training must align with emerging technological advancements and global industry requirements to ensure employability. During a comprehensive review of the Skill Development Department on Tuesday, he outlined measures to modernize workforce training. He instructed officials to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the State’s Skill Portal Naipunyam to identify and consolidate job openings not just within Andhra Pradesh but across India and international markets. The portal will also feature an automated resume builder, generating professional profiles for registered candidates based on their qualifications. To directly link job seekers with employers, the government will organise large-scale job fairs, with an immediate target of facilitating 1,500 placements per constituency this year. The State government has already secured commitments for Rs 9.5 lakh crore in industrial investments, which are projected to create 8.5 lakh jobs. To maximise these opportunities, Naidu stressed the importance of conducting skill gap analyses for IT graduates to better align training with industry needs, expanding apprenticeship programmes across all sectors to provide hands-on experience, and incorporating soft skills training alongside technical education to enhance employability. As part of the Swarnandhra 2047 development plan, the government is rolling out a comprehensive skill development framework aimed at nurturing a future-ready workforce. This initiative begins with the introduction of vocational training from Class 6, helping students build foundational competencies from an early age. To ensure that skills education is practical and industry-relevant, the government is strengthening collaborations between educational institutions and industry partners. Additionally, the adoption of the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) will help standardise training quality across AP, ensuring consistency, credibility, and alignment with national benchmarks. Skill Development Minister Nara Lokesh detailed the State’s innovative cluster-based training model, which tailors programmes to regional economic strengths. To support this initiative, the government has established partnerships with 162 industries for ITI training, and signed 63 MoUs with polytechnic institutes.",

In a letter to RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, AP Chambers welcomed the appointment of Attah Omar Basheer as the Regional Director and conveyed confidence in his leadership. Terming the move a major step for AP’s financial ecosystem, AP Chambers President Potluri Bhaskara Rao and General Secretary B Raja Sekhar said the decision reflects the RBI’s commitment to decentralised governance and inclusive development. They called it a “vote of confidence” in the State’s economic potential. AP Chambers submitted a set of key recommendations to strengthen the MSME sector. These include expanding access to CGTMSE, allowing agricultural land as collateral, capping SME loan interest rates at 9%, reducing dependence on credit ratings, extending NPA classification to 180 days, and introducing a permanent MSME loan restructuring framework. The Chambers urged the RBI to mandate participation of large corporates and PSUs on the TReDS platform and promote digital lending, alternate credit scoring, and financial literacy for MSMEs. They suggested incentives for banks and NBFCs supporting women-led, SC/ST, and rural MSMEs. It proposed regular RBI ‘Town Hall’ meetings to address MSME concerns and pledged to support financial literacy efforts with the new office.",

            "content": "A 32-year-old private land surveyor from Gadwal was found murdered in Andhra Pradesh’s Nandyal district, 30 days after his wedding. The body was recovered over 200 kilometres from his hometown, near the Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) canal on June 21. The Gadwal police have detained five suspects, including his wife, Iswarya, a native of Kurnool, in what the police said was a premeditated murder linked to an affair. The case resembles the recent Meghalaya honeymoon murder , in which an Indore-based newlywed Raja Raghuvanshi was killed by his wife and her lover during the couple’s honeymoon in the East Khasi Hills. The victim in the Gadwal case, Tejeswar, who is also a dance teacher, stepped out for work on June 17 but did not return home, prompting his brother to file a missing person complaint on June 18. After tracking the mobile location, the body was found near the Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) canal. Gadwal Town Sub Inspector of Police Kummari Srinivas, who is investigating the case, said the murder was premeditated and appears to be linked to Iswarya’s alleged affair with Tirumala Rao, a manager at a non-banking finance company in Gadwal. The two were allegedly involved for the past three years, despite Mr. Rao being married for the last six years. CCTV footage showed Tejeswar getting into a sedan with three occupants, all contract killers hired by Mr. Rao. The men claimed that a land parcel near Erravalli needed a survey. Unaware of their intentions, he joined them. “The vehicle drove towards Erravalli and stopped at Veerapuram stage, off the national highway (NH) 44. There, the assailants attacked him with a knife and suffocated him by sitting on his neck. His body was later dumped over 100 kilometres away near the HNSS canal,” the official explained. Meticulous planning The official said that the murder was the result of meticulous planning that spanned nearly three months. “The hired killers had been conducting repeated reccees along the route from Kurnool to Gadwal, closely studying the victim’s movements and familiarising themselves with possible escape paths. Mobile phone records have revealed frequent communication between the accused, all pointing that the suspects carefully planning each stage of the crime,” the official explained. The wedding between Tejeswar and Iswarya was originally scheduled for January 10 but was called off by the victim’s family based on some suspicion. However, Iswarya later persuaded Tejeswar, and the two tied the knot on May 18. “This change of plans could be a part of the larger manipulation, as the timeline suggests that planning for the murder began shortly after the couple reunited,” the official said. Further investigation is underway.",

            "description": "Leaders of ruling TDP are accusing the ex-CM & his partymen of ignoring police restrictions on his Palnadu visit, while Jagan says inadequate security arrangements caused the death.",
            "content": "Hyderabad: The death of an aged YSRCP supporter, allegedly after coming under former Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s car, has sparked a massive row, with the ruling and opposition sides blaming each other for the fatal mishap last week. Andhra Pradesh police booked the YSRCP chief for culpable homicide, along with his government-provided driver Ramana Reddy. YSRCP senior leaders inside the car—including former ministers Perni Venkataramaiah and Vidadala Rajini—were also named in the case. Jagan has alleged inadequate security arrangements caused the death and accused the Naidu regime of resorting to “diversionary tactics to cover its unfulfilled poll promises”. A short video clip that surfaced on social media Sunday showed Cheeli Singaiah being dragged for a few seconds by the front right tyre of a black SUV. The clip showed Jagan at the left front door of the same vehicle, as the car was swarmed with enthusiastic party workers, causing a din. One worker even climbed on the bonnet with a placard to grab Jagan’s attention. Jagan was greeting people, apparently unaware of the man being run over by the car at a slow pace. The incident occurred on 18 June at Yetukuru in Guntur district, when the former CM was on his way to Rentapalla village in Palnadu district to visit the family of a party activist who died by suicide last June. That death also sparked controversy with the YSRCP blaming TDP leaders’ harassment, while the ruling party said Nagamalleswara Rao, whose statue Jagan unveiled Wednesday, ended his life after suffering huge losses after gambling on a YSRCP victory. “Jagan’s odarpu (solace) yatra is very strange, coming over a year after Rao’s death. We, in fact, can blame Jagan for his death, as believing the YSRCP chief’s absurd claims of winning 175 out of 175 seats, Rao wagered huge amounts on Jagan’s victory. Unable to pay it off, the YSRCP supporter ended his life,” TDP politburo member Varla Ramaiah said on the day of the visit. TDP leaders like home minister Vangalapudi Anitha accuse Jagan and his partymen of ignoring police restrictions on his Palnadu visit and also of insensitivity by not rushing the injured Singaiah to the hospital in time. On Sunday night, Guntur SP Satish Kumar, who earlier stated that Singaiah was hit by an unidentified car, addressed a press meet to reveal the latest details. “What I said was based on available evidence that day. After analysing various videos, CCTV, drone footage, etc., and questioning the witnesses, we have noticed that the man fell under the SUV and a tyre ran over him,” Kumar told reporters. The SP said that while a case was booked last week based on a complaint by Singaiah’s widow, Mary, the charges have been altered in light of fresh evidence. The SP reportedly stated that while Jagan’s convoy to Palnadu had permission for 11 plus three vehicles, “the former CM’s entourage proceeded in 50 cars from his Tadepalli residence”. Singaiah, who was found lying injured beside the road, was taken to the hospital in an ambulance by locals and a police officer, but doctors declared him brought dead. Also read: Naidu rolls out ‘Thalliki Vandanam’, expanding Jagan’s Amma Vodi scheme. 24 lakh more students covered Jagan lashed out at Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu over the case Monday, “accusing him of political vendetta and degrading the standards of politics” in Andhra Pradesh. In a lengthy post on X , Jagan charged the CM of “imposing deliberate restrictions on his Rentapalla tour”. The former chief minister said the current administration was preventing him from visiting party workers or expressing solidarity with farmers and citizens. “Neither Chandrababu nor Pawan Kalyan ever faced such restrictions during their tours when he was in power,” he added. Emphasising his Z+ security status as a former chief minister, Jagan said that he followed all rules, gave prior information to the authorities about his visit, but the state government failed to provide the necessary security arrangements.” “Why were there no pilot vehicles or rope parties deployed during my visit, as part of the standard Z+ security protocol. If the security arrangements were in place, how could anyone have come under the vehicle,” Jagan questioned in the post. Jagan also alleged that as the Naidu government “did not provide a bulletproof vehicle, mandatory under protocol”, he had arranged one at his own expense, but used the government-provided driver, an Armed Reserve constable named Ramana Reddy. Jagan accused Naidu and the TDP of diversionary politics with the tragic case as he was going to the public, questioning the ruling combine’s one year of unfulfilled promises and governance failures. Referring to the SP’s initial statement on the incident, Jagan asked why the narrative was later “changed and politicised”. Jagan said that he was informed of Singaiah’s death only during his return from the Rentapalla tour and that he immediately instructed his party leaders to provide help, while announcing Rs 10 lakh compensation to the victim’s family. Jagan added that another YSRCP supporter died due to a heart attack during the same tour, and that he extended similar support to that family as well. “A poisonous campaign is on against us, but what about Chandrababu’s responses in similar situations?” Jagan asked, referring to stampede deaths at Naidu-attended TDP rallies at Kandukur and Guntur two and a half years ago, when he was the opposition leader. Eleven people died in the two incidents in December 2022 and January 2023.

Launched by the Ministry of External Affairs, the operation has facilitated the return of 1,713 Indians amid the Iran-Israel conflict, using alternate routes via Armenia and Turkmenistan, he said. \"Evacuees were first relocated from Tehran to safer cities like Mashhad and Qom, with the Indian Embassy coordinating transport, and 17 members have arrived in Delhi from Iran today (Tuesday) before 6 am,\" said Srikanth in a press release. Of them, 10 checked into Andhra Bhawan, while the remaining seven stayed back at the airport to catch connecting flights for their onward journey, he said. After diplomatic efforts, Iran reopened its airspace, enabling six Mahan Air flights between June 20-22 that brought back 1,568 Indian nationals, followed by another flight on June 22, he added. Srikanth noted that Andhra Pradesh Bhavan has arranged reception, lodging, meals, healthcare, and onward transport for all Andhra Pradesh evacuees. Coordination is underway with Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu Society (APNRTS) and other volunteer groups to offer psychological and logistical support, the release said. He said that efforts continue to evacuate the remaining 800 Indians, prioritising students and vulnerable individuals still stranded in affected regions.

            "description": "The increased shortage of doctors, nurses, technicians, and allied health staff is driven by an aging workforce, rising chronic disease burdens, and demographic shifts globally.",
            "content": "A staggering one-third of frontline nurses have witnessed patients die due to staff shortages, laying bare the catastrophic impact of an overburdened healthcare workforce. Research also suggests a link between healthcare worker shortages and excess deaths—a 10% reduction in professional nursing staff correlates with an 11% rise in patient mortality risk. This is an indication of a silent pandemic that is underway: a surging global shortage of healthcare workers crippling healthcare systems. The world has moved on from the COVID-19 pandemic, but unlike acute pandemics that spark immediate alarm, this insidious threat is growing quietly, eroding care quality, delaying treatments, and amplifying preventable deaths across nations. Without urgent systemic reforms, the talent shortfall in healthcare, projected to reach 18 million by 2030, threatens to destabilise global health infrastructure, leaving billions vulnerable to inadequate care. Understanding the talent gap The increased shortage of doctors, nurses, technicians, and allied health staff is driven by an ageing workforce, rising chronic disease burdens, and demographic shifts globally. Developed nations like the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, and much of Europe are already reeling, with the EU alone facing a deficit of 5 million doctors, nurses, and midwives. Germany struggles with a shortfall of over 1.5 million nurses, while the UK’s NHS grapples with 112,000 vacancies, increasingly filled by professionals from countries like India, Morocco, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, etc. This highlights a vicious cycle of global brain drain and insufficient training pipelines that leaves no region unscathed. Recent industry insights estimate that approximately 88,000 nurses work abroad. For doctors, a 2023 Statista report noted 75,000 Indian-trained doctors in OECD countries. Combined with nurses, this suggests 120,000–150,000 healthcare professionals leave annually. Many have claimed that 250,000–300,000 nurses have left since 2020, out of 640,000 working abroad. Combined, we’re looking at roughly 150,000–200,000 healthcare professionals leaving annually, but India is producing doctors and nurses with an increased capacity of 80-100% that has been seen in the last 5 years under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Ayushman Bharat and Heal by India missions. The migration journey is often further plagued with inefficiencies—workers face high upfront costs, complex visa and licensing procedures, and limited access to structured support. Many candidates struggle with fragmented recruitment systems, a lack of transparent information, and unverified agents, leaving them vulnerable to misinformation and exploitation. Employers, meanwhile, wrestle with their own challenges: delays in credential recognition, costly and slow onboarding processes, and poor retention due to a lack of cultural integration or career pathways. These twin inefficiencies highlight the urgent need for a unified, digitally enabled system to support ethical, efficient talent mobility. The healthcare talent gap is worsening due to burnout, high attrition, and looming retirements. Mental health support is now a top priority for 76% of professionals, yet remains inadequately addressed. Only 64% feel equipped to handle emerging tech like AI, with confidence lowest in North America. With global talent growth at just 1.5% annually and one in five nurses set to retire within a decade, urgent reforms are needed to boost training, retention, and tech readiness across the sector. Impact on healthcare systems The global shortage of healthcare workers is severely compromising patient care, manifesting in longer wait times, reduced access to services, and increased medical errors. Understaffed facilities force healthcare providers to manage larger patient loads, leading to rushed interactions that erode the quality of care. High patient-to-nurse ratios are directly linked to poorer outcomes, with studies showing elevated error rates, higher morbidity and mortality, and increased nurse burnout, particularly in high-turnover emergency departments. Rural communities face acute disparities, with only a few offering hospital-based obstetrics services, leaving critical gaps in essential care like maternal health. The economic fallout from this workforce shortage further strains healthcare systems, driving up costs and deepening inequities. Hospitals face a 15.6% surge in labour costs per adjusted discharge compared to pre-pandemic levels, forcing budget cuts that often compromise care quality. The financial burden, coupled with the inability to meet rising patient demands, creates a vicious cycle that threatens the sustainability of healthcare systems. What’s being done and what’s missing As a leading hub of healthcare talent, India plays a pivotal role in addressing the global shortage. States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh are at the forefront of this migration. Strategic agreements, such as the 2022 German-Indian Migration and Mobility Agreement and the 2024 India-EFTA Trade Pact with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, aim to streamline movement for Indian healthcare professionals to countries grappling with acute shortages. In the MENA region, destinations like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar attract Indian talent with competitive pay and modern healthcare infrastructure. Yet, despite these bilateral frameworks, both skilled healthcare workers and global employers face persistent inefficiencies and risks. Professionals encounter an arduous migration process marked by complex documentation, unclear qualification recognition, high costs, language barriers, and a lack of access to transparent recruitment channels. For example, 13.2% of Indian visa applications to Switzerland were rejected in 2022, underscoring how stringent immigration policies still pose challenges. Recognition of Indian diplomas has also remained inconsistent, leaving many candidates in limbo. Those from rural areas are particularly disadvantaged, often lacking access to resources like language training, certification support, and trusted job networks—critical components for success in global healthcare roles. At the same time, employers struggle to identify, evaluate, and onboard international talent efficiently, often relying on outdated, manual processes that delay critical staffing. Technology is now stepping in to bridge this disconnect. AI-powered recruitment platforms are streamlining the end-to-end hiring journey, offering verified talent pools, automated pre-screening, and transparent evaluation processes. These platforms ensure better candidate-job matches, accelerate compliance workflows, and reduce dependency on intermediaries, while helping professionals access ethical, well-supported pathways to global opportunities. By combining data-driven decision-making with a human-first approach, such technology is transforming cross-border healthcare hiring into a faster, fairer, and more reliable system for all. The road ahead To secure the future of caregiving, the global community must pivot from ad hoc responses to coordinated, systems-level solutions. This begins with reimagining caregiver training as a global public good, with cross-border curricula, certification standards, and scalable learning models, particularly for emerging markets. International alliances—such as between India and Germany or through the EFTA pact—should evolve into multilateral frameworks that support talent mobility through automatic credential recognition, low-barrier visa programmes, and centralised migration portals. In parallel, we have platforms that are enabling employers and candidates to simplify the cross-border migration process. These systems feed a global caregiving intelligence network led by the WHO or a similar multilateral body, enabling real-time collaboration and crisis response. Additionally, integrated digital tools—from AI-powered scheduling platforms to virtual training simulators—are augmenting human caregiving, reducing administrative burdens, and expanding access to mentorship and upskilling. Yet, technology alone won’t retain talent. Governments and healthcare systems must create caregiver-first workplaces that offer competitive pay, mental health support, flexible hours, and career progression pathways. This isn’t just about solving a labour shortage—it’s about building an ecosystem that values care work as critical infrastructure. Only by investing in this foundational pillar can nations ensure dignity, safety, and equitable care for their most vulnerable populations.

This ruling allows disciplinary action against employees involved in such disputes, emphasizing the importance of integrity both professionally and personally. Read below to know how this impacts private and government employees.",
            "content": "ET Online Husband loses his government job as wife filed matrimonial dispute and she won; High Court answers why A dismissed government employee fighting to be reinstated in his job for eight years, lost the case when the Madras High Court ruled against him on June 17, 2025. The reason the government employee lost his job in the first place was because his wife had filed a matrimonial dispute case against him and he had been implicated as a criminal in that case. The Madras High Court upheld this reason of dismissal- matrimonial dispute and ruled in the government's favour. Income Tax Guide Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 Income Tax Calculator 2025 New Income Tax Bill 2025 In legal parlance, the Madras High Court ruled that matrimonial dispute should be treated as misconduct under the Tamil Nadu Government Servants’ Conduct Rules, 1973 allowing government departments to initiate disciplinary action against such misconduct of employees, once proved. The Madras High Court further said that a public servant is expected to maintain honesty, integrity and good conduct not just inside the office but outside as well. As pointed out by lawyers, a point to be noted here is that private sector employers also initiates disciplinary action on their employees for matrimonial offences if there's a court conviction, and this trend is expected to continue. Keep reading to find out how this judgement affects employees, as lawyers informed ET Wealth Online that similar rulings (dismissal from job due to matrimonial disputes) have occurred in Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and other states. How did this case start? Here’s the timeline of events according to the order of the Madras High Court dated June 17, 2025: January 28, 2013: A person got a government job working as a dental assistant in the state-run hospital. July 13, 2017: The government dismissed this employee as he was deemed guilty in the matrimonial dispute case filed by his wife. February 1, 2018: This dismissed employee filed a case under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in the writ court and the court ruled in his favour by saying matrimonial dispute may not be sufficient reason for misconduct. This government filed an appeal against this order of the writ court in the Madras High Court. What did Madras High Court say? According to the order of the Madras High Court dated June 17, 2025, here’s what the court said: The respondent (employee) was appointed as a dental assistant for a period of one year on contract basis. The contractual engagement was renewed from time to time. The respondent (employee) was implicated in a criminal case. Thus, he was disengaged by the appellants (government) vide order dated 13.07.2017. The writ court formed an opinion that the criminal case registered in a matrimonial dispute may not be an impediment for continuance of the government contractual employment. Under the Tamil Nadu Government Servants' Conduct Rules, 1973, matrimonial dispute is also a misconduct and the Government Departments are empowered to initiate action against such misconducts. A public servant is expected to maintain honesty, integrity and good conduct both inside the office and in the society. Therefore, for the misconduct, even if it is committed in the matrimonial relationship, the Government Departments are empowered to initiate departmental disciplinary proceedings. Judgement: “Accordingly, the writ order dated 01.02.2018, passed in W.P. (MD) No.248 of 2018, is set aside and the writ appeal stands allowed. No costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed.” What does Rule 19(2) of Tamil Nadu Government servants conduct rules say? In this case cited here, the employee was dismissed due to violation of Rule 19(2). Vinay Joy, Partner at Khaitan & Co says: “The judgment does not clearly specify the nature of the matrimonial misconduct the Madras High Court was addressing. Rule 19(2) of the Tamil Nadu Government Servants’ Conduct Rules, 1973 can be interpreted to mean that acts involving moral turpitude within the marital sphere constitute misconduct. The primary misconduct contemplated under this rule is ‘bigamy’ which most states’ government / civil servants’ rules seem to prohibit.” Joy adds: “While government / civil service rules typically classify specific matrimonial acts - such as bigamy, dowry, and neglect of wife and children (which, incidentally, are all offences in India in some form) - as misconduct, most state service rules do not contain the language around ‘moral turpitude’ like the one seen in the Tamil Nadu Rules. For example, the government service rules in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat and West Bengal do not contain such language.” Joy adds that due to the lack of specific details around the facts contested here, it is unclear if the Court is simply referring to bigamy or to some other form of ‘matrimonial dispute’ of a similarly serious nature - or whether it is using the term ‘matrimonial dispute’ in its ordinary sense. Do other states also follow similar rules for their employees? Vedant Choudhary, Associate, SKV Law Offices, says “In addition to Tamil Nadu, several other states across India recognize matrimonial misconduct as valid grounds for disciplinary action against government employees. Jurisdictions such as Uttar Pradesh (as seen in Khursheed Khan V. State of Uttar Pradesh), Rajasthan (Laxman Singh V State of Rajasthan and Ors.), Karnataka, and Kerala have all upheld similar principles.” Aditya Chopra, founder and managing partner, The Victoriam Legalis says: “As per the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1965, no government servant who has a wife, shall contract another marriage without first obtaining the permissions of the Government provided that such subsequent marriage is permissible under the personal law applicable to such government servant. A similar rule exists for Uttar Pradesh as well under Section 29 of the UP Government Servant’s Conduct Rules, 1956.” Choudhary says: “Even where not expressly adjudicated, many state conduct rules—such as those in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and others—require prior permission of relevant authorities for remarriage. A violation of such provisions constitutes misconduct, thereby subjecting the employee to departmental proceedings.” What about private sector employees? Smriti Jaswal, Senior Associate, Accord Juris LLP, a law firm says: “As far as the private corporations and its employees are concerned, they are bound by their own HR Rules, Regulations and Policies that have been laid down to maintain the integrity of their company that very strictly bind all its employees. Joy from Khaitan and Co says: “We do see private employers initiating disciplinary action against employees in relation to matrimonial offences when the employee has been convicted by a court in relation to the same and the same is likely to continue being the practice.” Joy adds: “Such instances in private sector employment are generally governed by contractual terms and standing orders / internal service rules, which, in my experience, typically do not regulate conduct in personal relationships / private life. They usually limit themselves to conduct during the course of, or in connection with, employment. This is for two main reasons: Regulating an employee’s conduct in their private life may be considered an overreach by the employer, and the information a private employer can seek from an employee is also strictly regulated by privacy law; and the practical difficulties posed by the private nature of such misconduct during disciplinary inquiries in terms of summoning witnesses, gathering evidence etc.” Jaswal says matrimonial dispute can be the reason behind denial of higher promotion in some companies. She says: “Interestingly, some companies are promoting their employees to a senior level such as VP, etc after they conduct background checks and interview people in the employee’s circle, as these officials in such senior positions are going to be representing products and act as the face of the company. Therefore, in the event in the private sector you want to climb up the ladder - there is no room whatsoever for any indiscretion and having a criminal record more specifically one where there is a matrimonial dispute, will reflect negatively on your leadership skills and your ability to maintain interpersonal relationships.” This judgement is a matter of interpretation Kheyali Singh, Associate Partner, Singhania & Co, says: This judgment of the Hon’ble Madras High Court could be a milestone in the service law with regard to misconduct for being implicated in a matrimonial dispute. However, it is a matter of interpretation, and the said judgement could be challenged before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.” Singh adds: “There is no such rule in India, where matrimonial dispute is considered as misconduct due to which a government employee can face action like getting suspended or fired. There is no definition under the rules that considers implication in a matrimonial dispute as misconduct. The relevant rule is rule 19 of Tamil Nadu Government Servants' Conduct Rules, 1973 which could be looked into. Further the judgement of the Hon’ble Division Bench of the Madras High Court is a matter of interpretation of the concerned service rules. There is no state which consists of any rule that getting involved in a matrimonial dispute is considered to be a misconduct. However, it is a matter of interpretation and if an FIR is registered and prosecution begins then the Department has the discretion to initiate disciplinary action against the delinquent employee.”",

Seena Naik convened a meeting with the temple’s Leases and Land Department staff to address the encroachment of 11.54 acres of temple land located in Vijayawada’s Kedareswarapeta – Lotus area. The land, valued at approximately ₹200 crore, was found to be illegally occupied. To prevent unauthorised transactions, the lands have now been officially listed under Section 22A 1C (Prohibited Properties). EO Seena Naik stressed that the temple administration, in coordination with the Revenue, Stamps & Registration, and Municipal Administration Departments, is taking immediate and uncompromising action. To address space constraints in the lower Mahāmaṇḍapam zone, the EO held another meeting with temple engineers to evaluate land acquisition for future infrastructure, including a new Anna Prasadam hall and Laddu Potu (kitchen). Executive Engineers Koteshwara Rao and Rambabu were among those present, and discussions centered on maximising available space for upcoming facilities, keeping in view the rising footfall of pilgrims.",

Leela Sai Narasimha (8) had been found at their house on June 12. The accused married a woman named Chandrika about 12 years ago, and the couple had two children. While Chandrika was staying in Bahrain, Ravi Shankar was working in a catering unit here. He suspected his wife of infidelity, said Mylavaram Circle Inspector D. Chandrashekar. On June 7, the accused allegedly strangled his son to death with a saree and then smothered Hiranya to death with a pillow. He purportedly left a note stating that he too was ending his life, but, instead, escaped, said police. Neighbours alerted police on June 12 after a foul smell started emanating from the house. A team led by Deputy Commissioner of Police K.M. Maheswara Raju, Assistant Commissioner of Police Y. Prasad Rao and Mylavaram SI K. Sudhakar detected the case.",

కార్యక్రమాన్ని నిర్వహించింది. ఈ కార్యక్రమానికి రాష్ట్ర డిప్యూటీ ముఖ్యమంత్రి, జనసేన అధినేత పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ హాజరయ్యారు. ఈ సందర్భంగా ఆయన సంచలన వ్యాఖ్యలు చేశారు.భవిష్యత్తు గురించి..పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ మాట్లాడుతూ, తాను ఎప్పుడూ రాష్ట్ర భవిష్యత్తు గురించి ఆలోచిస్తానని చెప్పారు. గతంలో అధికారంలో ఉన్న ప్రభుత్వం రాష్ట్రాన్ని అభివృద్ధి దిశగా తీసుకెళ్లాల్సిన సమయంలో నాశనం చేసినదిగా విమర్శించారు. 2019లో అధికారంలోకి వచ్చిన ప్రభుత్వం ప్రజలకు ఉపయోగపడే కార్యక్రమాల కంటే కలహాలు, కుట్రలు, అక్రమాలతో నిండిన పాలన చేసినదని ఆయన అన్నారు.ప్రజల పక్షాన నిలబడే పాలన...ప్రస్తుత ప్రభుత్వం చంద్రబాబు నాయుడు నాయకత్వంలో నడుస్తోందని, ఇది మున్ముందు మంచి పాలనకు మార్గదర్శిగా నిలుస్తుందని పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ విశ్వాసం వ్యక్తం చేశారు. ఇది కేవలం సాధారణ ప్రభుత్వంగా కాకుండా ప్రజల పక్షాన నిలబడే పాలనగా మారుతుందని ఆయన చెప్పారు.అంతేగాక, ప్రజల భద్రత విషయంలో ప్రభుత్వం ఎంత కఠినంగా వ్యవహరిస్తుందో కూడా పవన్ స్పష్టంగా చెప్పారు. రాష్ట్రంలో శాంతిభద్రతలు దెబ్బతినే పరిస్థితులు తలెత్తితే చూస్తూ ఊరుకోమని ఆయన హెచ్చరించారు. ప్రజల్లో భయం రేకెత్తించే ప్రయత్నాలు చేస్తే, ప్రభుత్వం దాన్ని సహించదని ఆయన పేర్కొన్నారు.అయితే పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ ఈ సందర్భంలో కొన్ని సంఘటనలను ఉద్దేశిస్తూ, \"బ్యానర్లు పట్టుకొని రోడ్డెక్కి గొంతుకలు కోస్తామంటూ బెదిరింపులు చేసే వాళ్లకు ఇది సినిమాల కాదు, ప్రభుత్వ పాలన\" అనే తగిన సూటిగా సమాధానం ఇచ్చారు. తాను సినిమాల్లోనూ ఉండి ఉన్నప్పటికీ, ఇప్పుడు ప్రజల బాధ్యత తనపై ఉందని, అలాంటి మాటలు ప్రభుత్వ పరంగా అసహ్యంగా అనిపిస్తాయని పేర్కొన్నారు.ప్రజల్లో భద్రత గురించి చిన్న కలత వచ్చినా ప్రభుత్వం చర్యలు తీసుకోకుండా ఉండదని చెప్పారు. ఇది ఎవరికైనా హెచ్చరికలుగా తీసుకోవాలని ఆయన సూచించారు. ప్రజలకు భద్రత కల్పించడం ప్రభుత్వ ప్రధాన బాధ్యత అని, అది లేనిదే అభివృద్ధి సాధ్యం కాదని ఆయన తెలిపారు.‘సుపరిపాలనలో తొలి అడుగు’...‘సుపరిపాలనలో తొలి అడుగు’ కార్యక్రమం ద్వారా కూటమి ప్రభుత్వం తమ పాలనా పురోగతిని ప్రజల ముందుంచే ప్రయత్నం చేసింది. ఈ కార్యక్రమంలో ప్రభుత్వ మంత్రులు, అధికారులు, పార్టీ శ్రేణులు పాల్గొన్నారు. కార్యక్రమంలో ఇప్పటి వరకు చేపట్టిన అభివృద్ధి పనులు, రాబోయే లక్ష్యాలపై కూడా చర్చ జరిగింది.పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ స్పీచ్లో రాష్ట్ర రాజకీయ దిశ, పాలన తీరుపై మాత్రమే కాకుండా, భద్రతా వ్యవస్థలపై కూడా దృష్టి పెట్టడం గమనించదగిన విషయం. ముఖ్యంగా ఇటీవల రాష్ట్రంలో కొన్ని సంఘటనల నేపథ్యంలో ఆయన వ్యాఖ్యలు ప్రాధాన్యం సంతరించుకున్నాయి. ప్రజల్లో భయం, అనిశ్చితి లేకుండా ఉండే విధంగా ప్రభుత్వం ముందడుగు వేస్తుందనే సంకేతాలివ్వాలని ఆయన ప్రయత్నించారు.ఇది కేవలం రాజకీయ కార్యక్రమం మాత్రమే కాదు, ప్రభుత్వం ప్రజలకు ఇచ్చే ఒక సంకల్ప ప్రకటన కూడా. ప్రజల మధ్య నమ్మకం పెంచేలా, పాలనపై విశ్వాసం కలిగించేలా మాట్లాడడం ద్వారా పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ కూటమి ప్రభుత్వం ప్రజల పక్షాన ఉందని చెప్పే ప్రయత్నం చేశారు.పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ మాట్లాడుతూ, \"శాంతిభద్రతల విషయంలో ఎవరు కూడా మోసగించలేరు. చిన్నపాటి సమస్య వచ్చినా దాన్ని తక్కువగా తీసుకోము. ఇది మా ప్రభుత్వ విధానం. ప్రజల్లో భయం పెరగకుండా, వారికి భద్రత కల్పించడమే మా ప్రథమ కర్తవ్యం\" అని తెలిపారు.ఇటీవల వచ్చిన కొన్ని రాజకీయ వ్యాఖ్యలపై కూడా ఆయన స్పందించారు. సినిమాల్లో వాడే డైలాగులు రియల్ పాలిటిక్స్కి పనికిరావని, ప్రభుత్వ వ్యవస్థలు అలాంటి మాటలతో కాదు, చర్యలతో పనిచేస్తాయని వివరించారు. \"గొంతుకలు కోస్తాం\" లాంటి భయానకమైన మాటలు ప్రజాస్వామ్యంలో చోటు ఉండవు. అలాంటి వ్యాఖ్యలు చేసే వారిపై ప్రభుత్వం కఠినంగా వ్యవహరించే అవకాశముందని ఆయన సూచించారు.ఈ సందర్భంగా పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ చంద్రబాబు నాయుడు నాయకత్వంపై విశ్వాసం కూడా ప్రకటించారు. గతంలో ఆయన ప్రభుత్వ అనుభవం, పరిపాలనలో నైపుణ్యం కలిగి ఉన్న నాయకుడు అని, కూటమి ప్రభుత్వం ఆయన మార్గదర్శకత్వంలో రాష్ట్రాన్ని ముందుకు నడిపిస్తుందనే నమ్మకం ఉందని వివరించారు.ఇంతవరకూ చేసిన అభివృద్ధి పనులను వివరిస్తూ, రాబోయే రోజుల్లో

            "content": "GUNTUR: In a significant breakthrough, police arrested three individuals—including a minor—in connection with the brutal double murder of two elderly women in Tenali. The accused have been identified as Peravali Kusuma Kumari (46), Illa Gopi Krishna (25), and a 17-year-old juvenile, Sheikh Abdul Kalam. The victims, Dasari Rajeshwari (59) and Peta Anjamma (70), were widows living together in a two-storey house on Parimi Road, Mallapadu. On June 19, the accused allegedly entered their home posing as potential tenants and murdered them using a metal rod and a cotton towel. They then fled with cash and gold ornaments. Crucial CCTV footage monitored remotely by Rajeshwari’s daughter in Chennai helped identify the suspects. Tenali Police formed special teams under DSP B Janardhan Rao’s supervision and tracked the culprits using both technical inputs and physical evidence, following instructions from Guntur District SP. During interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime. Notably, Kusuma Kumari was also involved in a previous murder for gold. Police recovered Rs 34,500 in cash, a gold chain, imitation bangles, an auto-rickshaw used in the crime, gloves, shoes, and other evidence. All three were produced before court on June 23 and remanded to judicial custody. Guntur SP praised CI S Ramesh Babu, SI SK Kareemulla, and their teams for swift and effective investigation.",

            "description": "The state home minister on Monday alleged that the party workers dragged away the body after the accident and threw “him in the bushes in an inhuman manner”.",
            "content": "A political slugfest has erupted in Andhra Pradesh over the death of a 70-year-old man after he was run over by YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) president and former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s car during the latter’s tour to Rentapala village of Palnadu district on June 18 to call on the family of a party leader who died by suicide last year. The state home minister on Monday alleged that the party workers dragged away the body after the accident and threw “him in the bushes in an inhuman manner”. The Guntur district police on Sunday registered a case against Jagan, his driver Ramana Reddy, personal assistant K Nageshwar Reddy and two YSRCP leaders, on the basis of visuals showing Cheeli Singaiah being run over by Jagan’s car at Etukuru bypass road under Nallapadu police station limits. Based on the complaint filed by the victim’s wife Cheeli Lurdhu Mary, the police initially booked a case under Section 106(1) of Bharatiya Nyana Samhita (causing death by negligence), but after analysing various video footages, CCTV footages, drone visuals and circumstantial witnesses about the incident, the sections were altered to BNS sections 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 49 (abetment of crime). A senior official privy to the investigation, on condition of anonymity, said Jagan’s driver Ramana Reddy was taken into custody on Monday for questioning. “The police have also questioned Jagan’s security personnel, including chief security officer, to find out what exactly happened on that day,” he said. State home minister Vangalapudi Anitha told reporters on Monday that the state government had provided Z+ security cover to Jagan Mohan Reddy during his Palnadu tour but gave him permission only for four cars in total from Tadepalli to Sattenapalli. “But Jagan completely violated the restrictions and went ahead with a huge road show with over 100 cars in the convoy,” she said. She said as per police approval, only 100 people were permitted to gather, but the YSRCP mobilised thousands of people again in violation of the police approval. “When Singaiah came under the wheels of his car, the party workers dragged him away and threw him in the bushes in an inhuman manner,” she alleged. She said the police, who had received information of the accident, rushed there and shifted Singaiah to the hospital, where he was declared dead. “The video evidence also clearly indicates that several people were asking the driver and passengers to stop the vehicle, which was disregarded. It clearly shows lack of sensitivity after the tragic accident occurred,” she said. The YSRCP chief alleged that the matter was the result of vindictive politics of the state government led by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu with regard to the death of Singaiah during his visit to Rentapala village. In a statement posted on X, Jagan alleged that the police imposed deliberate restrictions during his tour to Rentapala and questioned why he was restricted from visiting his own party worker or expressing solidarity with farmers and citizens. “This political vendetta now threatens not just democracy but basic decency,” he said. Jagan said arranging Z+ security for a former chief minister was not a favour but a protocol-based right, just as it was applied to Chandrababu Naidu in the past. He claimed that he followed all the rules and gave prior information to the authorities about his visit, yet the state government failed to provide the necessary security arrangements. He questioned why there were no pilot vehicles or rope parties deployed during his visit, which are part of the standard Z+ security protocol. “If the security arrangements were in place, how could anyone have come under the vehicle?” he asked. Jagan also said though the government did not provide him a bulletproof vehicle, which is mandatory under protocol, he arranged for one at his own expense. The former chief minister added that he had used a government-provided driver and hence, “all the responsibility for the convoy’s safety lies with the government,” he said. He referred to the SP’s initial statement on the incident, asking why the narrative was later changed and politicised, and accused the ruling coalition of using this tragic incident as a distraction from their governance failures. The YSRCP supremo claimed that after learning about the unfortunate death of his party worker Singaiah, he immediately instructed his party leaders to provide help and announced ₹ 10 lakh compensation to the septuagenarian Singaiah’s family.",

            "content": "Another shocking case similar to the murder of Indore businessman Raja Raghuvanshi has come to light in Andhra Pradesh. Just less than a month after his wedding, 32-year-old Tejeshwar from Gadwal district was found dead in a canal in Panyam area of Nandyal district. He was working as a private licensed land surveyor and a dance teacher. Tejeshwar married Ishwarya from Kurnool district on 18 May. Their wedding was actually scheduled for February, but was postponed because five days before the marriage, the woman left her home without informing anyone. Later, she returned to her home and told Tejeshwar that, as her mother couldn’t give dowry, she left her home and went to her friend’s house. Tejeshwar went missing on 17 June, and his family members reported this to the Gadwal police. The police lodged a missing case on 17 June and started looking for the victim. According to media reports, Tejeswar's family alleged that Ishwarya was in an extramarital affair and has accused her of plotting his murder. The family members had warned him against marrying Ishwarya, but he was adamant. Preliminary investigation found that Ishwarya is having an affair with another man who is a bank employee in Kurnool. She was constantly in touch with him after getting married. The newlywed wife and her mother, Sujatha, have been arrested by the police in connection with the case. Raja Raghuvanshi's body was found in a mutilated condition in a gorge near Sohra (Cherrapunji) in Meghalaya on 2 June. He was on his honeymoon with his wife, Sonam Raghuvanshi, a key accused in his murder. A district and sessions court in Meghalaya's Shillong on Saturday sent Sonam Raghuvanshi and Raj Kushwaha to 13 days of judicial custody in connection with the Raja murder case. Assistant Public Prosecutor Tushar Chanda said the accused has been remanded to judicial custody since the police didn't ask for custody. “The court has remanded both the accused for 13 days of judicial custody. The police did not ask for custody. The Investigating Officer pleaded for judicial custody. The court granted 13-day judicial custody,” Chanda told ANI.",

            "description": "Apex industry body EPTA urges govt to extend ISTS charges waiver till March 2026",
            "content": "New Delhi, Jun 23 (PTI) Apex industry body Electric Power Transmission Association (EPTA) on Monday urged the government to safeguard the viability of around 30 GW clean energy projects facing risks from delays beyond the control of developers by extending the Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges waiver till March 2026. Investments of about ₹ 2 lakh crore will be impacted if a relief is not given to the players in the form of extension in the waiver, G P Upadhyaya, the Director General of EPTA said while speaking to the media in the national capital. The government had announced a waiver for solar and wind projects to be set up and commissioned by June 30, 2025. Upadhyaya said \"around 30 GW green capacity are under advance stages of development across various states. These projects are unlikely to be set up before June this year on account of multiple reasons\". The capacity has been delayed due to reasons beyond power companies' control and they may move to CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission) for solutions that may further delay in commissioning of these projects spread over states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra among others. In some places there is issue of land availability, local issues, Great Indian bustard (a bustard is especially found in Rajasthan and Gujarat), he said in reply to a question on reasons for delay in projects. On a solution, the DG said, \"We are not seeking a blanket extension. We are only proposing that the projects which have achieved key development milestones, such as securing financial closure, acquiring at least 50 per cent of required land, and placing key equipment orders, should be granted a 6-9 month window to avail the ISTS waiver benefits.\" As another alternative, Upadhyaya suggested recommended a more gradual phase-out of the waiver, starting with a 10 per cent withdrawal every year instead of the proposed 25 per cent. Such a calibrated approach would significantly ease the impact of the waiver's withdrawal on the cost of green power, thereby allowing RE power to stay competitive and attract more investments in this key sector. The industry is of the view that the proposed withdrawal at 25 per cent per year will disrupt ongoing projects, jeopardise investments, and undermine cost competitiveness, especially for commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers who already pay among the highest electricity tariffs globally, he said.",

            "content": "New Delhi, Jun 23 (PTI) Apex industry body Electric Power Transmission Association (EPTA) on Monday urged the government to safeguard the viability of around 30 GW clean energy projects facing risks from delays beyond the control of developers by extending the Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges waiver till March 2026. Investments of about Rs 2 lakh crore will be impacted if a relief is not given to the players in the form of extension in the waiver, G P Upadhyaya, the Director General of EPTA said while speaking to the media in the national capital. The government had announced a waiver for solar and wind projects to be set up and commissioned by June 30, 2025. Upadhyaya said \"around 30 GW green capacity are under advance stages of development across various states. These projects are unlikely to be set up before June this year on account of multiple reasons\". The capacity has been delayed due to reasons beyond power companies' control and they may move to CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission) for solutions that may further delay in commissioning of these projects spread over states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra among others. In some places there is issue of land availability, local issues, Great Indian bustard (a bustard is especially found in Rajasthan and Gujarat), he said in reply to a question on reasons for delay in projects. On a solution, the DG said, \"We are not seeking a blanket extension. We are only proposing that the projects which have achieved key development milestones, such as securing financial closure, acquiring at least 50 per cent of required land, and placing key equipment orders, should be granted a 6-9 month window to avail the ISTS waiver benefits.\" As another alternative, Upadhyaya suggested recommended a more gradual phase-out of the waiver, starting with a 10 per cent withdrawal every year instead of the proposed 25 per cent.

            "content": "What happens when you challenge budding engineers and developers to build something that’s not just cool, but also makes the world a better place? That was the spirit behind a recent hackathon hosted by Locus, a global supply chain automation company, known for helping businesses perfect omni-channel fulfillment and delivery across all-miles. Before it became a global leader in logistics and supply chain tech, Locus began its journey with RideSafe , a navigation app dedicated to women’s safety. This year, the organization went back to its roots. On Women’s Day, Locus launched ‘Code For Her’ , a hackathon open to young tech talent across India, inviting them to reimagine women’s safety through the lens of AI, data, and design. But here’s the twist: the focus wasn’t on just celebrating Women’s Day. It was on sparking purposeful innovation , nudging the next generation of developers, builders and creators to think critically about the world around them, and how their skills can make it better. \"At Locus, we’ve always believed that technology finds its true meaning in the problems it solves,\" said Geet Garg, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Locus . \"This hackathon wasn’t about building the next viral app, but rather about sparking a mindset. We wanted young developers to see that when engineering is combined with empathy and intention, AI can do more than automate - it can protect, empower, and truly make a difference.\" The Winners The hackathon received entries from first-year college students to early-career professionals solving for a common brief: designing an intelligent safety system that can help individuals, especially women, travel more confidently. 1st Place: Guardian Agents Ashish Kumaraswamy , along with his team members Mathana Mathav and Arvind Puthocode , all young techies from Tamil Nadu, built something that went beyond navigation. Their AI-powered app introduced intelligent safety companions or ‘Guardian Agents’ that monitor real-time risk, and think efficiently to step in when something feels less than ideal. In addition to route planning, the app also acts like a protective presence on every journey. “As a team passionate about AI and technology, we saw this as an opportunity to apply Agentic AI frameworks to address a real-world issue. The hackathon offered a platform to combine our technical skills with a socially relevant cause, motivating us to contribute and make a difference” - Ashish and his team shared . 2nd Place: NirbhayaPath Shaik Mohammed Huzaifa , Software Engineer from Andhra Pradesh, built a highly intuitive and adaptive route-planning platform that integrates police data, community reviews, lighting conditions, and crime trends. The robust app features a safe route finder, a co-commuter matching tool ‘Sathi’, a smart SOS and escort mode along with community sourced safety ratings and AI-led risk predictions. 3rd Place: SafeDen Srushti Kumar , a 3rd-year Computer Science and Design student at KSIET, Bangalore designed a sleek safety dashboard with verified ‘safe havens’, real-time journey tracking, and tiered emergency support for different situations where help might be needed. Why This Still Matters Women’s safety isn’t a one-day conversation to be had on 8th March and forgotten for the rest of the time. According to 2025 NCRB data , over 88% of women in Indian metros report feeling unsafe after dark , with 60% altering their routes to avoid risk. The need for smart, user-first safety technology is urgent and ongoing. Initiatives like these act as ‘nudges’ towards responsibility, empathy, and a tech culture that values solving problems for the world. \"As an organization that has always stood for building with empathy and innovating purposefully we were genuinely impressed.” said Vittal Sirigiri, Head of Data Science at Locus. “What really stood out was how these young minds thought about risk, behavior, context and not just code. Every entry showed a desire to use AI in ways that could genuinely help people. That’s the kind of thinking we were hoping to spark with CodeForHer. And honestly, that’s the kind of mindset we look for in our teams - curious, socially aware, and driven to solve real-world problems”. Beyond the competition, this was also a quiet testament to the tech culture we are building at Locus. In an industry often dominated by speed, optimization, and cost-efficiency, this hackathon was a reminder that tech should never lose sight of its human purpose . About Locus: Founded in 2015, Locus is a leading global supply chain automation company transforming decision-making through the power of AI and ML.

            "content": "The Cabinet sub-Committee approved new land allotments for six institutions and revised allocations for four previously approved entities, in Capital city Amaravati, in Andhra Pradesh , on Monday (June 23, 2025) in its meeting held at Secretariat, Amaravati. While Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development P. Narayana and Minister for Industries T.G. Bharat attended the meeting in person, two more Ministers including Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav and Tourism Minister Kandula Durgesh attended through online. Amaravati will be developed as world-class capital city as promised: Pawan Kalyan Two earlier land allotments have also been cancelled, Minister Narayana announced after the committee’s meeting. Addressing the media, Mr. Narayana said several institutions that were allotted land during 2014–19 had withdrawn during the previous government’s tenure owing to administrative inaction and the confusion caused by the three-capital proposal. He said consultations were under way with such institutions to reconsider their plans. CM Naidu urges Centre to notify Amaravati as the capital In the latest move, the committee sanctioned land to ten institutions — six new and four with revised allocations. Among the new beneficiaries are the Income Tax Department (2 acres), A.P. Grameena Bank (2 acres), Central Bank of India (0.4 acres), Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau (0.5 acres), Bureau of Immigration (0.5 acres), and the BJP State Office (2 acres). Revisions were approved for allocations made earlier to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI – 2 acres), Geological Survey of India (2 acres), State Forensic Science Laboratory (5 acres), and Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Bank Limited (3 acres). Meanwhile, allotments made earlier to GAIL India Private Limited and Ambica Agarbathi Company have been cancelled for non-fulfilment of commitments. So far, 884 acres have been allotted to 64 institutions, and with the new approvals, the number has reached 74. Minister Narayana emphasised that construction work in Amaravati is picking up pace, with more than 10,000 workers currently on site. Once the monsoon recedes, he said, activity will intensify with nearly 20,000 workers expected to be engaged in capital development.",

But this case has a twist: the woman and her mother were romantically involved with the same man. A 32-year-old Telangana-based land surveyor was discovered murdered in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool district. His newlywed wife and his mother-in-law were taken into custody for allegedly plotting his murder with the help of the mother & daughter's shared love interest. The deceased has been identified as Tejeshwar and his wife Aishwarya. The lover, a bank employee, is absconding. Tejeshwar and Aishwarya got married on May 18, 2025 and Tejeshwar had reportedly gone missing on June 17 and his dead body was found the same day about 30-40 km east of Kurnool city in Andhra Pradesh. Reportedly, Tejeshwar was lured under the pretext of conducting a land survey, murdered in a moving vehicle, after which his body was dumped.The lover is believed to have hired contract killers to murder Tejeshwar. Reportedly, days before her engagement, Aishwarya had gone missing, allegedly eloping with her lover. She returned after a few days, claiming she had only visited a friend due to family pressure over dowry. As things went forward, Tejeshwar noticed Aishwarya secretly talking on the phone and distancing herself emotionally from her newly married husband. Call data records later showed over 2,000 calls between Aishwarya and the bank employee even after the wedding. Reportedly, the reason behind the murder was Tejeshwar’s property and assets, and his objections to his wife’s association with the lover. Reportedly, the bank employee arranged for contract killers and even sent his own driver with them. Both Aishwarya and her mother Sujata have reportedly confessed to their role in plotting the murder during the interrogation. A search is on for the absconding bank employee and other suspects involved in the murder.",

Both the husband and wife were IT technicians.\"A wall was recently constructed, and four lives of a family were lost due to the wall. Both the wife and husband worked as IT technicians. We are demanding justice for the family. How can a wall be constructed without pillar support? I am demanding action against the contractor and engineer of the wall construction. The Government should announce one crore ex gratia and one government job to family members. Without announcing it, we wouldn`t allow post-mortems on the deceased bodies,\" he told ANI.Another relative of the deceased family members reiterated their demand for a thorough investigation into the matter and for the government to take action against the officers involved in the substandard construction of the wall.\"We need justice for losing our family members. The government should take action against the officers involved in the poor construction of the wall. Four members of my family lost their lives at the same time. Who will take responsibility for our family? The government should give one government job and ex gratia to us,\" the family member stated.(With inputs from ANI)",

His newlywed wife and her mother have been detained in connection with the case. Tejeswar worked as a private land surveyor and also taught dance.

Police have detained Ishwarya and her mother, Sujatha, and are currently questioning them. A senior officer told the media that the investigation is ongoing but declined to confirm or deny the family's allegations. According to Tejeswar's family, Ishwarya’s mother, Sujatha, is employed at a bank, and Ishwarya was allegedly in a relationship with a fellow bank employee. At the same time, she was also involved with Tejeswar, and the two agreed to marry. Their wedding, originally scheduled for February, had to be postponed after Ishwarya briefly went missing. She later returned, professed her love for Tejeswar, and the two were married, according to the NDTV report. Family members claimed they had warned Tejeswar against marrying Ishwarya, but he remained firm in his decision. They now suspect that Ishwarya and her mother plotted his murder.

            "content": "In a chilling case of betrayal and murder, a newlywed man was allegedly killed by contract killers hired by his wife and her boyfriend, just weeks after their wedding. The victim, 29-year-old Tejeshwar, a licensed private surveyor from Gadwal district, had married Aishwarya from Kurnool district on May 18. Shockingly, police say Aishwarya and her lover plotted his murder and had him killed on June 17 — less than a month after their wedding. According to police sources, the couple’s marriage had already seen turbulence even before it began. Initially scheduled for February, the wedding was postponed after Aishwarya went missing just five days before the ceremony. Her sudden disappearance led to suspicions of an affair. However, she returned days later and assured Tejeshwar that she had no relationship with anyone, claiming instead that she had left due to her mother’s inability to arrange the dowry. Tejeshwar, believing her explanation, went ahead with the wedding on May 18. Trouble resurfaced on June 17 when Tejeshwar went missing. His family filed a missing persons report with the Gadwal police, who launched a search operation. Days later, his body was recovered from the Panyam area in Andhra Pradesh’s Nandyal district. The investigation revealed a disturbing plot: Aishwarya was reportedly in constant contact with her lover, a bank employee in Kurnool, even after her marriage. Police believe the two orchestrated the murder by hiring contract killers to abduct Tejeshwar from Gadwal, murder him, and dump the body in Nandyal. The missing case has now been converted into a murder investigation. Gadwal police are on the hunt for Aishwarya, her boyfriend, and the hired killers — all of whom are currently absconding. Further investigation is underway.",

His family alleged that his wife had an extramarital affair. Hardly a few weeks after the murder of Raja Raghuvanshi shocked the country, a similar case may have surfaced in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool, where a man was found dead a month after his wedding and his family has alleged that his newlywed wife was in an extramarital affair. The body of Tejeswar, 32, was found in a canal after he went missing on June 17, a month after his wedding. His wife and mother-in-law have been detained in connection with the case, reported NDTV . Tejeswar worked as a private land surveyor and a dance teacher. His family alleged that his wife, Ishwarya, was in an extramarital affair and accused her of plotting his murder. A police official said an investigation was underway, but refused to confirm the allegations of extramarital affair and murder. Tejeswar’s family claimed Ishwarya was in a relationship with an employee at a bank, where her mother Sujatha worked. However, she was also in a relationship with Tejeswar and the duo had agreed to marry. ALSO READ: ‘Could Have Eloped, Why Killed Him?’: Raja Raghuvanshi’s Brother Questions Raj Kushwaha’s Motive The wedding was originally scheduled for February but was delayed when Ishwarya disappeared unexpectedly, as per the report. She resurfaced after some time, declared her love for Tejeswar, and the two eventually tied the knot. Police said Tejeswar went missing since June 17, prompting his brother, Tejavardhan, to file a missing person complaint, as per reports. Authorities located his body on Saturday near a canal using mobile location tracking. The remains were handed over to police for further investigation. The victim’s brother alleged that Ishwarya was involved in an extramarital affair with the bank employee, who was also romantically involved with her mother, and they had conspired together to kill Tejeswar. The accused lured Tejeswar under the pretext of a land survey assignment and murdered him with the help of close associates, he alleged. Meanwhile, police have identified a car that is believed to be linked to the crime, and are questioning the driver and owner of the vehicle. This came after the murder of Raja Raghuvanshi, a business from Indore, sparked nationwide outrage, as his wife Sonam Raghuvanshi is the prime accused. Raja Raghuvanshi went missing on May 23 during a honeymoon trip to Cherrapunji. His body was discovered on June 2 near the Wei Sawdong Falls in East Khasi Hills. Raghuvanshi’s murder was allegedly planned by Sonam and her alleged lover, Raj Kushwaha, and carried out by three hired hitmen. All of them are in police custody.",

            "content": "Guntur: Andhra Pradesh Police, YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) chief and former Chief Minister Y.S.An FIR has been lodged against Jagan Mohan Reddy and his driver Ramana Reddy.The case has been reported on the death of a 65 -year -old party worker Cheli Singaiya, who was killed in an accident during Jagan's convoy on Wednesday.Police say the accident occurred on the outskirts of Guntur district.The accident occurred when Jagan's convoy was going to Satyamapalli to meet the family members of a party worker who had committed suicide a year ago.Earlier, private vehicle was held responsible. In the beginning, the police held a private vehicle responsible for the accident, but later changed their statement that the deceased was crushed by Jagan Mohan Reddy's car.Guntur Superintendent of Police Satish Kumar said that there is enough evidence to prove that the Singaiya Y.S.Jagan was crushed under the wheels of Mohan Reddy's car.On this basis, we have amended the relevant sections and driver Ramana Reddy as well as Jagan Mohan Reddy, former MP Y.A case has been registered against V. Subbaarddy, former ministers Vidadala Rajni and Parni Nani.The driver detained the driver, the driver Ramana Reddy has been taken into custody and is being questioned.According to officials, the police want to know why the driver did not stop the car even after the accident and why the convoy kept moving forward.On this whole incident, YSR Congress has questioned the change in the statement of Guntur police.The party says that the SP had earlier clearly stated that the accident occurred from a private vehicle, which was not part of the convoy.But now the same police are registering a case against the leaders by holding the main vehicle responsible, which can be a sign of political pressure according to the party.",

Tejeswar, 32, went missing on June 17, a month after the wedding on May 18. His body has now been found in a canal. He worked as a private land surveyor and a dance teacher. Tejeswar's family has alleged that his wife, Ishwarya, was in an extramarital affair and has accused her of plotting his murder. Police have detained Ishwarya and her mother, Sujatha, and are questioning them. A senior officer told the media that the probe was on, but refused to confirm or reject Tejeswar's family's allegations. According to Tejeswar's family, Ishwarya's mother, Sujatha, works at a bank. Ishwarya was in a relationship with a bank employee, they claimed. Parallely, she was in a relationship with Tejeswar and the two agreed to marry. The wedding was scheduled for February, but had to be postponed after Ishwarya went missing. She later returned, professed her love for Tejeswar and got married. Tejeswar's family members said they warned him against marrying Ishwarya, but he was adamant. They now suspect that the newlywed woman and her mother plotted his murder. Tejeswar's death comes amid massive outrage over the murder of Indore businessman Raja Raghuvanshi on his honeymoon. Raja married Sonam on May 11 and they left for a trip to Meghalaya a week later. Raja and Sonam went missing on May 23 and his mutilated body was found in a gorge on June 2. Investigation into the case led to a chilling discovery: Sonam allegedly plotted Raja's murder with her lover. She surrendered to police on June 8 and other accused were arrested too.

Officials initiated action against the two officials after it was found that one bag was kept with the cashier rather than depositing them in the bank. Following complaint that the bags were kept with the cashier against norms, an internal enquiry was conducted following which action has been initiated against the two officials for their negligence. The two are junior assistant B Srinivasulu, who is the cashier, and another junior assistant H. Manjunath. Temple Executive Officer M Srinivasa Rao, in a statement on Sunday (June 22, 2025) said, it was found that a bag was left behind in the Chandravati Kalyana Mandapam after the Hundi counting process on May 27 this year. The bag was handed over to the cashier by the security staff and when the accounts department officials opened it, they found coins of 10 paise, 20 paise, 25 paise and 50 paise, which are not in use now, dropped in the Hundi by the devotees. There were a few coins of ₹1 and ₹2,which were later segregated and was dropped in the Goddess Bhramarambha temple Hundi. Taking the incident seriously, the officials conducted the enquiry and found the two officials were negligent in their duties and subsequently action was initiated against them. Mr. Srinivasa Rao said the counting process will be held in a foolproof manner and is recorded by CC Cameras. The process is monitored by the security staff from the control room and also at the Chitravathi Kalyana Mandapam. Officials of the district endowments will also be monitoring the process, he said. Further, the EO said one of the suspended junior assistant Manjunath was transferred to Sri Varasiddi Vinayaka Swamy temple at Kanipakam in Chittoor district in the recent regular transfers. The suspension orders were handed over to Manjuanth through the Kanipakam temple executive officer and the latter was asked to implement the orders, the statement said.",

Most Indians living in Israel are construction workers and caretakers. “Most Indians don’t want to leave because returning means losing their jobs, which are their primary livelihood,” Ravi explained. “There’s fear that once they leave, companies will replace them, adding to the financial burden of existing debts back home.”Even with employers’ consent, returning to Israel and regaining the same job with comparable pay is uncertain. “Employers may find permanent replacements, jeopardising employment stability,” he said.‘Indians earn more here’Indian workers in Israel often earn more than in other countries, Ravi noted. “How can they be expected to abandon stable, well-paying jobs for an uncertain future?”After the embassy’s evacuation announcement, Ravi shared a voice message in a WhatsApp group with nearly 1,000 members. “Only four responded. That shows how secure people feel here.”He added that life in Tel Aviv remains manageable. “The situation is under control. We follow safety protocols and take shelter in bunkers when alarms sound.”",

            "content": "Addressing infertility as a public health concern rather than a private burden is key to supporting India's demographic future To understand the context better, the latest report released by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), titled ‘The Real Fertility Crisis’, found that around 30 per cent Indians have an unfulfilled desire to have either more or fewer children. It said that millions of individuals are not able to realise their true fertility goals—a crisis that often goes unnoticed. Data show that India’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined to roughly 1.9 births per woman, which is below the replacement threshold of 2.1. The report says that the real crisis is not underpopulation or overpopulation, but rather that people are unable to have as many children as they wish. It highlights that the key health-related barrier is infertility, which affects nearly 13 per cent of the population and prevents many couples from starting or expanding families. Since the report’s launch, several IVF chains have made announcements related to expansion or undertaken promotional activities. Market gearing up in smaller towns In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) clinics are now trying to become a common sight across Tier-II and Tier-III cities. The report highlights that with 1 in 6 couples in India experiencing infertility, there is a growing need to improve access to fertility care in these areas. Recognising the big business potential, these chains have been pushing into smaller markets like Haldwani, Namakkal, Meerut, Prayagraj, Vellore and others. Shobhit Agarwal, CEO of Nova IVF Fertility, told News18 that half of the company’s centres are in these underserved areas. “Accessibility remains a major challenge in Tier-II and Tier-III regions, where couples often must travel to metro cities, incurring additional costs for travel and accommodation. Our expansion into towns like Pollachi, Tiruppur, Namakkal, Guntur, and Vellore is aimed at bridging this gap and making international-standard fertility treatment available in these regions.\" He also pointed out that there is a “positive change\" happening in these regions with greater awareness, rising acceptance of fertility treatments, and improving affordability. “With states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Sikkim witnessing a steady fall in fertility rates, our presence in these markets is both timely and crucial.\" However, the major task at hand for these chains is to break the stigma and myths around IVF—a task that is already underway. According to Navin Desai, co-founder and clinical embryologist at Archish Fertility & IVF, the latest UNFPA report on population collapse is a stark reminder of the demographic shifts reshaping our world with ageing societies and declining birth rates. For the IVF sector, this presents both a concern and an opportunity. On one hand, it’s unfortunate that more individuals and couples are struggling with fertility; on the other hand, it reinforces the urgent need for accessible, high-quality fertility care. “This is a defining moment for the IVF industry to lead with innovation, improve access, and dismantle stigma—not just to meet rising demand, but to contribute meaningfully to the future of global reproductive health.\" Desai’s chain has recently launched a few initiatives focused on education and awareness, mainly to break the stigma and misinformation. One of those is the “Fearless Fertility\" campaign, which includes expert insights and digital content that debunks common myths such as IVF being the “last resort\" or only for older couples. It also runs myth-busting infographics and reels: “Bite-sized educational content addressing top myths like ‘IVF always results in twins’ or ‘infertility is only a woman’s issue’.\" These are localised into different languages to reach a broader audience. Birla Fertility & IVF launched a toll-free support line last week to offer free and confidential fertility counselling. The company said the service is available across India in English and Hindi and may expand into regional languages as well. “The aim is to provide accessible, stigma-free guidance for individuals and couples exploring or undergoing fertility-related decisions. The objective is to fill a gap in emotional and educational support for people navigating parenthood planning and challenges,\" said Abhishek Aggrawal, Chief Executive Officer, Birla Fertility & IVF. The chain currently operates around 30 centres in Tier-II and Tier-III cities and plans to open around 15 more in the financial year 2025–26, with two-thirds of them located in smaller cities. Indira IVF, the biggest infertility player in India, has also announced plans to enter over 25 Tier-III cities by the financial year 2027. Govt should take the lead While the private market is all in action, there is a need for price regulation as well as players who can serve those with limited resources and income. According to industry estimates, the average cost for accessing IVF services stands at around Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh per cycle in private clinics. “In Tier-I metro clinics such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, the cost could be as high as Rs 4 lakh per cycle, whereas in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, clinics ask for around Rs 80,000,\" said an industry expert, requesting anonymity. He explained that on average, couples require two to three IVF cycles to achieve a successful pregnancy, but this varies significantly based on age, health, embryo quality, and underlying fertility issues. “Some may achieve pregnancy in the first go, and some may not even after four to five attempts. Hence, IVF treatment often becomes a financial black hole.\" Sample this: If the cost of undergoing one cycle of IVF is Rs 1 lakh and a woman achieves pregnancy in the third attempt, the bill at IVF centres stands at Rs 3 lakh, and in the majority of cases, payments are made in advance. Hence, to help those who cannot afford private IVF chains, the government needs to intervene. An encouraging example is Mumbai’s government-run Cama Hospital, which is gearing up to provide free IVF treatment for women. Last year, it started offering basic fertility treatments such as intrauterine insemination and ovulation induction. Overall, the government should plan and play a crucial role in making IVF and fertility treatments more accessible and equitable. This can be achieved by including IVF under public health insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat, subsidising treatment costs for low-income couples, and expanding ART services in government hospitals through public-private partnerships. In short, addressing infertility as a public health concern rather than a private burden is key to supporting India’s demographic future.",

            "content": "HYDERABAD: The state Cabinet, which is scheduled to meet on Monday under the chairmanship of Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy, is likely to take a decision on holding local bodies elections in the state. Recently, Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Minister Danasari Anasuya alias Seethakka and Revenue and Housing Minister Ponguleti Srinivasa Reddy had hinted that the schedule for local body elections would be announced soon. The tenures of sarpanches, Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituency (MPTC) and Zilla Praja Parishad Territorial Constituency (ZPTC) members ended last year. For the record, there are a total of 12,769 sarpanch seats, 5,717 MPTC and 538 ZPTC seats in the state. Besides the conduct of local body polls, the Cabinet is also likely to discuss the possibility of providing 42 per cent reservations to BCs in upcoming elections. As the Bill passed by the Assembly on enhancing BC reservations to 42 per cent has been sent for the President’s approval, the Cabinet is likely to deliberate on how to go ahead with the BC quota issue. According to sources, the MPTC and ZPTC elections will be conducted first, after which the sarpanch polls will be held. They added that the ruling Congress is chalking out plans to highlight the development works and welfare schemes being implemented by the government in an attempt to secure as many seats as possible. As part of this plan, sources said the government has already disbursed about Rs 7,770 crore under the Rythu Bharosa scheme, benefiting 66.18 lakh farmers. The Congress leaders are of the view that the implementation of Indiramma housing and other schemes is likely to work in the party’s favour. Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Cabinet may also discuss the Godavari-Banakacherla project proposed by the Andhra Pradesh government. Recently, Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy strongly objected to AP’s plan and asked Union Jal Shakti Minister CR Patil to restrain the sibling state from going ahead with the project. It may be mentioned here that the CM, during an informal chat with reporters in Delhi, said if necessary, he will invite his AP counterpart N Chandrababu Naidu for talks on the issue. The Cabinet is also likely to discuss this issue, sources added.",

            "content": "MADURAI: Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan attacked 'fake secularists' and atheists for 'targeting Hinduism' at Lord Murugan devotees conference in Madurai on Sunday. Addressing the gathering of devotees, Hindu pontiffs, BJP leaders and members of Hindu outfits, he said secularism had become a convenient word for a lot of people, \"especially for atheists who don't believe in god\". Pawan Kalyan was clad in a green veshti, work by Murugan devotees, and spoke in Tamil. \"Secularism means no discrimination against any religion. But for them, secularism means no discrimination against any religion except Hinduism,\" he said. \"For atheists, it has become a habit to denigrate our gods. If this does not change it would become difficult to sustain Hindu dharma. I am not a fanatic, but I am a committed Hindu. I respect Christianity and Islam. But there should not be disrespect for Hindu dharma,\" he said. He called Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, an icon of thevars, an influential vote bank in south Tamil Nadu an incarnation of Lord Murugan, the 'world's first revolutionary leader'. Hindu Munnani and BJP leaders presented Pawan Kalyan a vel (spear). He had visited Thiruparankundram temple before the conference. The conference called for a 'Hindu unity' and protection of Hindu rights and temples. A resolution passed at the conference called upon the people to demonstrate the strength of the Hindu vote bank in upcoming assembly election in Tamil Nadu. Another resolution demanded that DMK stop \"treating temples as revenue sources\". BJP state president Nainar Nagenthran said Hindu Munnani has turned all the stones thrown at the conference into stepping stones and has conducted this conference. Hindu Munnani chief Kadeswara Subramaniam slammed state HR&CE minister P K Sekar Babu for posing hurdles to the conference. Former BJP state president K Annamalai said, \"The success of the conference shows that people have chosen 'Swami' over 'Nidhi' in this state,\" he said, a remark seen as a reference to AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami and DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin. Since the high court had directed that there should not be political speeches, all the speakers skipped political content. Though BJP's ally AIADMK chose not to speak about the Murugan conference, four former ministers from the party R B Udhayakumar, Sellur K Raju, Rajendhira Balaji and Kadambur Raju participated in the event. AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami had wished the conference success. Union minister of state L Murugan, BJP leaders H Raja, Tamilisai Soundararajan, Vanathi Srinivasan were also present. A separate stage was allocated for AIADMK leaders, while BJP senior leaders, various Adheenams, and Pawan Kalyan were seated on the main stage which was decorated with the six abodes of Lord Murugan. After Pawan Kalyan's speech, devotees sang 'Kandha Sashti Kavasam'. Hindu Munnani claimed it a record, saying it was the first time more than one lakh people had sung it together at a venue. The Lord Murugan devotees conference held in Madurai on Sunday called for 'Hindu unity' and protection of Hindu rights and temples. A resolution passed at the conference called upon the people to demonstrate the strength of the Hindu vote bank in the assembly election in Tamil Nadu next year. Another resolution demanded that the DMK govt 'stop treating temples as revenue sources and use funds to benefit devotees'. The conference held amid criticism from DMK, Congress, VCK and NTK also flayed 'fake secularists' and atheists. \"Do these so-called secularists have the guts to speak about other religions,\" asked Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan. AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami had deputed four of his former ministers to attend the event. DMK and its allies said BJP was holding the event to gain political mileage using religion. TNN",

Until now, devotees had to pay at the Laddu counter and pay cash.However, this is a waste of time and sometimes crowded.Now with the help of technology, Tithide has started the digital laddoo purchase process.In this new system, devotees can register their darshan ticket number in Kiosk and select the number of brownies and get a ticket through UPI or other digital payments.Tithe has given the opportunity to buy two brownies if the Aadhaar number is entered.However, there is an attempt to increase this limit to four lads in the future.It is very useful for those who have come to Tirumala without a darshan ticket. Currently, five kiosks have been set up under the Union Bank and Canara Bank at the Laddu counter and three more kiosks at the MBC inquiry center.These kiosks will also be available at the CRVO Center, Sripadmavati Guest House and other leading guest houses.The VIP Break Darshan Tickets will also be obtained through kiosks.The tickets will be released at 10 am, Srivani Darshan tickets at 11 am and the elderly and the disabled at 3 pm.Special entrance tickets will be available at 10 am on June 24 at 10 am.The current waiting time for the survival is about 24 hours.The compartments in the Vaikuntham queue complex are full.On Sunday, 87,254 devotees visited and 33,777 were presented.The total amount from Hundi is 4.28 crores.",

The grim discovery, made just a month after his marriage to Iswarya from Kallur, Kurnool, has sparked allegations of foul play, with the victim’s family pointing fingers at his wife and her alleged accomplices.According to Panyam Circle Inspector Kiran Kumar, Tejeswar had been missing since June 17, prompting his brother, Tejavardhan, to file a missing person complaint with Gadwal Town Police. Using mobile location tracking, authorities located his body on June 21 near the HNSS canal. The remains were subsequently handed over to the Gadwal police for further investigation. ‘CCTV footage helped identify car linked to crime’“The body was found based on precise tracking, and we’ve transferred the case to Gadwal for jurisdictional reasons,” Kumar stated.Tejavardhan, devastated by the loss, alleged that Iswarya was involved in an extramarital affair with Tirumala Rao, a bank manager in Kurnool. He further claimed that Iswarya’s mother was also romantically linked to Rao, and together they conspired to eliminate Tejeswar, perceiving him as an obstacle to their plans.According to the brother’s complaint, the accused lured Tejeswar under the pretext of a land survey assignment, only to murder him with the help of close associates.“Her frequent phone calls and secretive chats raised suspicions, but she dismissed them as talks with her mother,” Tejavardhan told police, noting the family’s growing concerns before the tragedy.Gadwal Circle Inspector T Srinivas, addressing the media, revealed that CCTV footage helped identify a car linked to the crime. The vehicle’s driver and owner are currently under interrogation. “We’re investigating all possibilities, including financial disputes or personal motives,” Srinivas said, adding that the probe is ongoing. He refrained from confirming the family’s allegations but assured a thorough investigation to uncover the truth.Tejeswar, known for his dual roles as a surveyor and a respected dance instructor, had married Iswarya on May 18 in a love marriage. His sudden disappearance and brutal murder have left his family and community grappling with grief and disbelief.As the probe continues, Gadwal police are piecing together evidence to determine the circumstances of Tejeswar’s death and roles of those implicated.",

            "content": "MADURAI: Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan on Sunday slammed “fake secularists” for targeting the Hindu faith in the name of freedom of expression and called for respecting all religions. He said the ‘secularists’ often criticise Hindu practices, but they don’t question other religions in India. “A Christian can be a Christian, a Muslim can be a Muslim but they have a problem if a Hindu is Hindu. If one is Hindu, they call him communal. This is their fake secularism. Who are you to question my belief. We don’t question your belief, you should follow that decency,” he said. Addressing a massive “Muruga Bhakthargal Maanadu”, a conference of devotees of Lord Murugan, here, Kalyan said, “I respect Christianity, Islam. My plea is don’t disrespect my faith.” The conference was organised by the Hindu Munnani (Hindu Front) and saw the participation of various Hindu organisations, outfits, pontiffs and leaders of the AIADMK and the BJP, including former TN BJP president K Annamalai. Kalyan said, “A political party chief questioned why Murugan maanadu is organised in TN, why not in UP or Gujarat? By asking such questions, he is attempting to divide the society.” He expressed fears that such questions may be directed tomorrow at Lord Shiva or Goddess Amman and said such a thought is “very very dangerous”. Kalyan said the word secularism was a “convenient word” for a lot of people. “Specifically to atheists who don’t believe in god; they should not believe in all gods. In India, they wouldn’t believe in Hindu gods. Secularism means no discrimination against any religion, but for them, secularism means no discrimination against any religion except Hinduism,” he said. The Jana Sena Party founder said freedom of expression was one “great weapon given by the Constitution”. It has become common to target Hindu gods in the name of freedom of expression. “This has to change. If this doesn’t change, it would be very difficult to sustain our religion, faith,” he said. Annamalai said, “We are not enemies to anyone, only trying to assert our rights. Hindus are enemies only to those who consider us enemies. Our Hindu culture shouldn’t be destroyed and there shouldn’t be religious conversion. In Tamil Nadu, there is a situation where spirituality, literature and Tamil are segregated. But these cannot be separated.” TN BJP president Nainar Nagenthran said, “We are planning to merge cultures – Tamil and Telugu, and also Tamil and Malayalam. This maanadu is one such bridging initiative.” Hindu Munnani chief Kadeswara Subramniam, local AIADMK MLAs and former ministers R B Udayakumar and Sellur K Raju, BJP leaders H Raja, Tamilisai Soundarajan, Pon Radhakrishnan and prominent BJP functionaries participated. Later, the ‘Kanda Sashti Kavacham’ was mass recited at the venue. Six resolutions were passed at the conference.",

            "content": "VIJAYAWADA: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the alleged Rs 3,500-crore liquor scam that reportedly took place during the previous YSR Congress Party regime has unearthed another startling revelation - engineering graduates and unemployed youth were used to transport and store illicit money procured from liquor sales and distillery commissions.The involvement of young professionals came to light during the questioning of one of the key persons and 34-year-old engineering graduate Katta Pranay Prakash by SIT officials recently. According to sources close to the probing agency, over 200 youth, mostly engineering graduates and unemployed youths with links to YSRCP leaders, were recruited between 2019 and 2024. These individuals were allegedly enticed with lucrative incentives for their participation. ‘Hired youths unaware of nature of assignments’Pranay, a native of Hyderabad, reportedly told investigators that he was introduced to the prime accused Kesireddy Rajashekar Reddy alias Raj Kesireddy and his personal assistant B Chanakya by an acquaintance named Kiran Kumar Reddy. Shortly after the new liquor policy was introduced in 2019, Pranay was instructed by the duo to secure a residence in Tadepalli or nearby areas for operational convenience. “Following their instructions, he rented an apartment in Landmark Apartments and began storing huge sums of cash in carton boxes. Initially unaware of the extent of his role, Pranay was gradually taken into confidence and promised a prominent position if the YSRCP returned to power,” a senior official revealed.As pressure mounted and the CID registered an FIR to probe irregularities in the liquor policy, Pranay was reportedly sent to Dubai. Officials said this tactic was also used for others closely involved, in order to avoid scrutiny.SIT sources further said that many of the hired youths were unaware of the exact nature of their assignments. “Chanakya played a key role in recruiting and monitoring the youth. After their tasks were completed, they were distanced from the core operatives of the scam. Some were even offered alternative jobs in Hyderabad and elsewhere to ensure their silence,” the official added.During the interrogation, Pranay also told the police that he and Raj Kesireddy, former Chandragiri MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar, his son Mohit Reddy and others held several meetings in Dubai and Tanzania regarding setting up factories in South African countries with the money obtained from the liquor sales.",

            "content": "VIJAYAWADA: Former Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy accused the TDP-led NDA government of violating key provisions of the Indian Constitution with its planned issuance of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) by the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) scheduled for June 24, 2025. In a strongly worded post on X, Jagan claimed that the move breaches Articles 203, 204, and 293(1), allowing private entities unauthorised access to the State’s Consolidated Fund without legislative consent. He alleged that the government has pledged mineral wealth valued at Rs 1.91 lakh crore to NCD holders, a decision he describes as ‘cheating the people’. He further highlighted an ongoing case in the Andhra Pradesh High Court, where notices have been served on respondents, questioning the government’s decision to proceed with the bond issuance amid sub-judice proceedings. “It is indeed very disheartening that the government is acting with total disregard to the Constitution of India, and the future of the State,” the YSRCP chief observed.",

            "content": "By Rohan Dutta Far from Delhi’s power corridors, in a modest office at Hyderabad’s Dr. MCR HRD Institute in Jubilee Hills, a bold experiment is quietly rewriting India’s national security playbook. The Centre for Human Security Studies (CHSS), led by Ramesh Kanneganti, is bringing national security discussions to regions often left out of the conversation. Unlike Delhi’s top-down approach, this Hyderabad-based think tank champions a bottom-up model, arguing that true national security must begin with food, water, health and education, not just military strength. “CHSS is the first think tank from South India to influence national security strategy, pushing to decentralise policymaking and bring regional perspectives into focus,” says Mr.Kanneganti. With key defence, IT, biotech and industrial sectors, as well as cultural diversity, the city serves as a natural hub for security thought leadership. CHSS advocates conflict prevention through dialogue, education and opportunity. Its model addresses poverty, unemployment and exclusion that fuel unrest. CHSS’ work spans four areas: research, capacity building, internships and blending academic insight with field practice. The think tank has conducted AI-Smart Policing workshops for senior IPS, IAS and State police officers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Its Mission E3 (Educate, Empower, Employ) internship initiative has trained over 15,000 students in the last decade, helping more young women pursue education and careers over early marriage. This grassroots focus also guides its deradicalisation and youth outreach efforts, especially in vulnerable regions. The aim is to widen young people’s sense of belonging in India’s strategic future rather than limit them to short-term jobs or schemes. One of its major projects, Mission Panchamukhi, conducted India’s largest coastal security review across nine States and four Union Territories. CHSS worked with fishermen, port authorities and security agencies to create AI and IoT-driven port security solutions tailored to local needs. CHSS created a seaport security syllabus for the Indian Maritime University and contributed to Telangana’s upcoming BA Honours course in Defence and Security Studies. Nationally, Mr.Kanneganti is also part of a UGC-approved National Security MOOC on the Swayam platform. Globally, Stanford University and the Australian War College have engaged with CHSS’s human-first model. But Mr.Kanneganti notes Indian universities are still under-involved in shaping security policy. (The writer is interning with The Hindu -Hyderabad)",

The case, initially considered a road mishap involving an unauthorised vehicle, took a serious turn after video evidence and eyewitness accounts revealed that the black SUV carrying Jagan had run over party worker Cheeli Singaiah. Speaking to the media on Sunday, Guntur SP S Satish Kumar said that, alongside Jagan, police have named his personal assistant K Nageshwar Reddy, former MP YV Subba Reddy, former ministers Perni Venkateswara Rao (Nani) and Vidadala Rajini, and driver Ramana Reddy, who has been allegedly taken into custody, as they were allegedly present in the vehicle at the time of the incident.The case, initially filed under Section 106(1) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) based on a complaint by the victim’s wife Cheeli Lurdhu Mary, has now been reclassified under Sections 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 49 (act endangering human life or personal safety of others). The incident occurred on June 18 near the Etukuru bypass in Guntur district during a political rally from Tadepalli to Rentapalla. More than 50 vehicles joined Jagan’s rallyAccording to the police, Singaiah tried to approach Jagan’s vehicle to throw flowers, slipped in the crowd, and fell under the front wheel. Though the vehicle paused briefly, it moved ahead, leaving the injured man behind. He was rushed to hospital by ASI Rajashekhar but was declared brought dead.Initially, the police claimed a white Tata Safari, unauthorised and ahead of the convoy, was responsible. However, after reviewing CCTV footage, drone visuals, and accounts from witnesses, they confirmed that the SUV carrying Jagan was directly involved in the mishap.The police had permitted only 14 vehicles for the rally, including the main convoy and support vehicles, but more than 50 joined, leading to confusion and serious crowd control failures. SP also noted that proper crowd management measures like circular ropes were not followed. He added that further legal action will be taken against the accused as per law.",

A case has been registered against YSRCP chief and former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, after a party supporter lost his life after being run over by a vehicle that was part of Reddy’s convoy in Guntur district. Guntur SP Satish Kumar said a case had been registered against Jagan Mohan for the death of Cheeli Singayya. On June 18, Jagan Mohan Reddy visited Rentapalla with a convoy of three vehicles to call on a family member of a YSRCP leader who had died by suicide a year ago. The event turned tragic as Singayya, who had gathered along the roadside with other YSRCP supporters, was knocked down by a vehicle in the convoy and sustained serious bleeding injuries.

Soon after, the man was taken to Guntur Government Hospital for treatment but he succumbed to his injuries. The tragedy raised concerns over crowd management and sparked widespread criticism regarding the lack of security oversight. “After analysing various evidence, it was found that the deceased was seen under the wheels of Jagan Mohan Reddy’s vehicle,\" said Guntur district Superintendent of Police (SP) S Satish Kumar, addressing a press conference late on Sunday. A case was initially registered under Section 106(1) of BNS (causing death by negligence) based on a complaint by his wife, Cheeli Lurdhu Mary, at the local police station. However, the SP said that after examining CCTV footage, drone videos, eyewitnesses, and other technical evidence, the case has been updated to include Sections 105 and 49 of the BNS, and legal action will be taken against all those present in the vehicle, including Jagan Mohan. Other accused include Jagan Mohan Reddy’s driver Ramana Reddy, Personal Assistant K Nageshwar Reddy, senior YSRCP leader YV Subbareddy, former MLA Perni Venkataramaiah, and former Minister Vidadala Rajini, Kumar told reporters.

A 15-year-old girl in Andhra Pradesh was admitted to the hospital after she got pregnant after allegedly being raped by 14 men over two years. The girl was first sexually assaulted in Class 8 and endured ongoing abuse until two months ago, when she was in Class 10, all while continuing to attend school, reported the Indian Express, citing District Superintendent of Police V Ratna. The girl, who lives with her mother, was not only assaulted but was also threatened and blackmailed by the accused. Reportedly, she belongs to the minority community. “It was her young age, vulnerability, and caste because of which the men could prey on and exploit her for two years, leaving her pregnant at 15. The systems that are in place to check on her welfare failed. Her class teacher did not even report that she had dropped out of school,’’ Superintendent of Police V Ratna told The Indian Express. The police have arrested 17 in connection to the crime, along with one minor, and an investigation into the matter is currently underway. A similar incident took place in September 2024 when a 13-year-old girl became pregnant allegedly after she was raped by a government school peon in Uttar Pradesh’s Farrukhabad. “The family of the 13-year-old girl has lodged a case against the accused men. The girl had gone to defecate at night when Pankaj and Amit of the village caught her and took her to an empty house where Amit raped her while Pankaj stood outside and kept a watch,\" a police official had said, citing the complaint. “The accused raped her by stuffing a cloth in her mouth. After this, the girl was threatened that if she complained, they would kill her. But when the girl became five months pregnant, her mother came to know about the matter. After which the mother approached the local police,\" the official had stated.",

            "content": "The party general secretary also expressed support for the Centre’s stand on the Indus Waters Treaty row, saying India was prepared to take tough decisions Andhra Pradesh will not spare anyone who breaks the law or promotes violence, declared TDP general secretary and state IT minister Nara Lokesh, delivering a pointed message that clearly targeted former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Lokesh’s stern stance came in response to a recent controversy surrounding Reddy’s YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) whose supporters invoked a dialogue from the Allu Arjun-starrer Pushpa 2 during a recent public meeting, comparing political adversaries to sacrificial animals. He used the line “Rapa Rapa Narukutham\" (we’ll chop heads one by one) during Reddy’s public rally to symbolise their supposed fate, drawing outrage from the ruling TDP. Noting how children were used to prop up such placards, Lokesh said: “Is this what a former chief minister should be teaching? Is that acceptable behaviour? We must be a peaceful state and a peaceful nation. If anybody breaks the law in Andhra Pradesh, nobody will be spared or let go.\" He reminded people that rights come with responsibilities. “We also have fundamental duties. Let’s not incite violence,\" he reiterated. Meanwhile, Lokesh said he was thrilled by the massive turnout at Visakhapatnam’s International Yoga Day celebrations led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. “It’s a movement,\" he said. “Both the PM and CM gave a call, and people just came to participate. It has given a sense of purpose to all.\" He recalled witnessing two world records in rapid succession: first, 22,000 tribal students formed a synchronised Surya Namaskar at the Andhra University Engineering Grounds—“adorable, disciplined, inspiring\". Then, on June 21, between 2.8-3 lakh people joined the beachfront session led by the prime minister. Lokesh noted that an additional one lakh people had set out to join but were hampered by traffic—underscoring the challenge and enthusiasm behind the event. “It was a massive undertaking,\" he commented. Lokesh emphasised that the event’s impact went far beyond a single day. Over 30 days leading up to June 21, trainers delivered thematic yoga sessions across three key religious and tourist locations daily, a strategy meant to spotlight Andhra Pradesh’s cultural and scenic value. “That’s why it became a movement,\" he said, thanking PM Modi for providing a platform to showcase Andhra’s strength and spirit. He echoed the prime minister’s appeal to balance prakriti (nature) and pragati (progress) and highlighted that the real power of this initiative lay in its unity—“people coming together\". Drawing attention to health concerns exacerbated by nuclear family lifestyles, he echoed statistics: “India has become the diabetes capital of the world. Obesity is the next big challenge.\" Stressing the prime minister’s call to reduce oil consumption by 10 per cent, he described it as both a directional and aspirational goal essential for longevity and holistic well-being for every Indian. When asked about Andhra’s competitive edge in attracting investment—particularly from Bengaluru—Lokesh stressed that Andhra is not luring away businesses, but engaging in healthy competition. “Competition makes states stronger,\" he explained. He outlined the presence of global corporations like KIA, Cognizant, Asian Paints, Apollo Tyres, Capgemini, Reliance, and ArcelorMittal in the state, highlighting Naidu’s aggressive push for business. “Andhra is known for its speed and ease of doing business and with an aggressive CM like Naidu, AP has been benefitted with the best in business.\" On Cognizant receiving land at 99 paise in AP, Lokesh defended the approach as part of taking bold steps. “Even PM Modi facilitated Tata Motors’ deal for Rs 1 per acre in Gujarat,\" he said. He also cited Andhra’s previous success in bringing Microsoft and ISB to Hyderabad as evidence of a determined economic strategy during Naidu’s earlier term. On national security, specifically Home Minister Amit Shah’s firm stance over the Indus Waters Treaty, Lokesh fully backed the Centre. “PM Modi has sent a strong message that anybody who attacks India will not be let off. We’re prepared to take tough decisions,\" he said. He recounted the personal sacrifice of Jawan Murali Naik from Andhra Pradesh, emphasising its deep resonance: “The son told his parents, ‘If I lay down my life, the entire country will come.’ And the father said, ‘The country has come for him.’ Jawans like Murali Naik have make India safe; their sacrifices make us feel safe.\" Turning to speculation within the party cadres of him becoming the chief minister, Lokesh firmly ruled out any personal ambition. “There is no second thought—our leader is only Naidu and he is our CM. No debate or discussion around it. I am a faithful karyakarta,\" he said.",

            "description": "People have been misled in the name of a revival package, and many employees have already lost their jobs, says party State secretary Srinivasa Rao; he also finds fault with the government spending ₹70 crore on Yogandhra programme",
            "content": "A day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Visakhapatnam to participate in the International Day of Yoga celebrations on Saturday (June 21), the CPI(M) on Friday demanded that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan secure a clear public commitment from him that the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) would remain in the public sector. Addressing the media in Vijayawada, party State secretary V. Srinivasa Rao expressed concern over the uncertain future of the steel plant, citing widespread fears over privatisation. The lion’s share of the ₹11,400 crore revival package allocated by the Union government was used to repay debts and taxes and the remaining for operational needs such as salaries, machinery, and raw materials, he said. “The package is an illusion meant to mislead the people. Thousands of employees have already lost their jobs, and now the plant faces the threat of privatisation. The BJP, the TDP, and the JSP have all misled the people in the name of a revival package. The recent allocation of mines and port access to the Mittal Group indicates backdoor privatisation efforts,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said. He also criticised the government’s expenditure of ₹70 crore on yoga promotion programmes, calling it wasteful at a time when basic needs like food, shelter, and employment remained unaddressed. “Millions already practice yoga individually. What people need is not mass yoga shows, but job security and livelihood support,” he said, adding that the funds should have been spent on improving children’s nutrition. Mr. Srinivasa Rao also raised doubts about the authenticity of the government’s claim that two crore people had registered themselves for the yoga programme. “The registrations are largely bogus. Even my name has been listed without consent. This is all done to chase a Guinness record,” he alleged, presenting documents to support his claim. Party Central Committee member D. Rama Devi condemned the recent incident in Kuppam where a woman had reportedly been tied to a tree and beaten by a moneylender. “This is the reality of women empowerment under this government,” she said.",

The land measuring 1.8 acres in survey number 295 of Kanuparthipadu village, abutting the Chennai-Kolkata National Highway and falling under Nellore rural constituency limits, belonged to Sri Ahobila Mutt and had been cultivated by lessee farmers for long. Learning of the issue, Mr. Kotamreddy Sridhar Reddy assured to do justice to Ahobila Mutt. On Thursday when the Mutt’s representatives visited the site to erect a board in the presence of revenue officials, followers of the former MP reportedly manhandled them and pushed the board down. Some official documents in the possession of the Village Revenue Officer D.V. Ramanaiah were also snatched. The VRO lodged a complaint with Nellore Rural police station over the incident. Mutt’s Nellore unit secretary K. C. Varadarajan on Friday (June 20), released a video through the social media, accusing former Member of Parliament Adala Prabhakar Reddy of trying to usurp the land, after promising to render justice for over 12 years. “Mr. Prabhakar Reddy purchased the land from persons who fraudulently claimed it to be their ancestral property. However, after coming to know of the fact, he agreed to ‘do justice’ to the Mutt, but dragged his feet for 12 years,” Mr. Varadarajan told The Hindu . He also maintained that the culprits had tampered with the revenue records using forged documents.",

Ms. Madhavi Reddy was seen standing for the entire session at the first meeting and did not take a seat among the corporators. After locking horns several times, four chairs were organised for Friday’s council meeting, one for Ms. Madhavi Reddy, the others for Putha Krishna Chaitanya Reddy, the TDP legislator of the adjoining Kamalapuram constituency (as the corporation limits extend into his constituency also), and two for the MLCs B. Ramgopal Reddy and Ramachandra Reddy. However, Mr. Suresh Babu conducted the meeting inside his chambers along with YSRCP corporators alone, and not in the council hall as is the practice. A notice in the name of Commissioner Manoj Reddy was pasted in front of the Mayor’s chambers stating that the meeting could not be conducted due to lack of quorum, indirectly hinting that the meeting chaired by the Mayor is not recognised. The notice created commotion at the council meeting hall.",

            "content": "Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has expressed his readiness to hold talks with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on the inter-State water disputes, particularly over the controversial Banakacherla project. In an informal chat with reporters in New Delhi on Friday (June 20), Mr. Reddy said he preferred dialogue over confrontation and inter-State water disputes can only be resolved through mutual understanding and cooperation. Mr. Revanth Reddy attributed the dispute to the Centre’s unilateral acceptance of Andhra Pradesh’s Pre-Feasibility Report (PFR) without consulting Telangana. “The urgency with which Centre responded after A.P. submitted the PFR is a concern,” he pointed out stressing for a balanced approach in dealing with such sensitive inter-State issues. Mr. Reddy opined that if Mr. Chandrababu Naidu wants to regain power, diverting Godavari water is a key aspect. If Mr. Modi wants his seat, he needs Mr. Chandrababu’s support. But such strategic interests must not undermine Telangana’s rights,” he said. The Chief Minister, who is in New Delhi for the last two days to represent to the Central government, said such matters should be addressed through legal and technical evaluation, not political blame game. These disputes were between States and not individuals, he said. The Chief Minister clarified that the Banakacherla project was an ancillary project to Polavaram, the only project specifically permitted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. The new project cannot go ahead without Telangana’s consent given its direct connection to the Godavari-Penna linkage. “A.P. issued two GOs in 2016 and 2018. Based on these, WAPCOS presented a 150-page report. The Banakacherla project proposes transferring 400 TMC in 86 days. Telangana has been allocated 968 TMCft from the Godavari as an upper riparian State, and Telangana must be allowed to fully utilise its share first,” he said. The issue would be taken up at the Cabinet meeting scheduled for June 23.",

            "content": "#TheMotherTheMapAndTheMovement #IndiaForAutism #PinnacleGlobalModel Opening Portrait The smell of boiled rice drifted from the kitchen. A temple bell rang in the distance. The sun had just begun to rise over a small village near Miryalaguda when Anjali, a 4-year-old girl with silent eyes and a world locked inside her, sat cross-legged on the ground outside her home. Her mother, Sushmita, gently placed the laminated mango flashcard — faded, fingerprinted, its corners curled from weeks of use — into her lap. For months, they had sat here. Same card. Same silence. But that morning was different. Anjali looked up. Her gaze met her mother’s eyes for the very first time. She didn’t speak. She didn’t need to. The silence broke with recognition — with connection — with something that had never happened before. What changed? Just three weeks earlier, they had begun receiving life-empowering therapy from a Pinnacle Blooms Network center. The therapist — Ravali Yadav a soft-spoken woman who spoke in their dialect and sat barefoot beside Sushmita — had shown her how to turn everyday routines into therapy. She left her with a packet of visual prompts, a few color-coded tools, and a printed sheet with something called an AbilityScore® — red zones, yellow zones, green zones. It looked like a report card. But for Sushmita, it was the first roadmap out of helplessness. Anjali had been seen. And now, she was beginning to see back. Across India — from tribal belts in Telangana to apartment corridors in Bengaluru — these moments are unfolding every day. Quiet. Private. Powerful. This isn’t a story about a therapy session. It is a story about hope rediscovered , voices unlocked , futures rewritten . And behind many of these moments is a silent revolution with a loud mission: Pinnacle . What began as one therapy center is now a 70-city movement. What started as a mother’s desperation is now a patented model. And what was once unmeasured is now being scored, mapped, and transformed with intelligence, empathy, and design. This is not just India’s story. This is a new chapter in how the world understands autism. And it starts on the floor, in a village, with a mother, a mango card, and a child who had no words — now reaching out to the world with her eyes. The Silence India Lived With In India, the silence around child development didn’t sound like neglect. It sounded like waiting. For decades, autism and speech delay were misunderstood as defiance, shyness, or bad parenting. Children who couldn’t express themselves were labeled “slow,” “stubborn,” or worse. Schools had no frameworks. Pediatricians had few screening tools. And families were told to do the most dangerous thing of all: “Wait and see.” But the numbers kept growing. The data told a quiet story. An estimated 1 in 68 children in India may be on the autism spectrum — a number likely underreported. 1 in 5 kids now show signs of speech or communication delay before the age of five. And perhaps most alarmingly, over 90% of neurodevelopmental issues remain undiagnosed or untreated until it is too late. In rural areas, one therapist may serve an entire district. In urban centers, waitlists stretch into months. Special education is an afterthought in most schools. Inclusion is more policy than practice. There is no unified screening protocol. No developmental scoring method. No language for families to understand what is truly happening to their children. And so, families waited. Hoped. Googled. Whispered. Cried. Because what India faced was not just a clinical gap. It was a crisis of clarity . Without data, there was no direction. Without tools, there was no therapy. Without language, there was no understanding. And without understanding — there was no hope. Until the silence met a system. One not handed down but built from the ground up . Until that system gave parents something they had never had before: A score. A plan. A voice. For free autism guidance in your language, call 9100181181 or WhatsApp us directly. The Rise of Pinnacle It did not begin with a plan. It began with a mother. A mother sitting across from doctors, specialists, and institutions that offered only three things: confusion, caution, and delay. Dr. Sreeja Reddy Saripalli was not just a healthcare entrepreneur. She was a mother. And like millions of parents across India, she was told to wait. To hope. To observe. But waiting was not enough. And hope, without a system, was cruelty. So she built what she could not find. In a modest room in Hyderabad — above a street shop, beside the sound of temple bells — she began assembling a team: speech therapists, occupational therapists, behavior analysts, special educators — all united by one question: “What if we created a place that understood not just autism, but kids, parents, families?” What followed was not a clinic. It was a quiet revolution. By 2014 , the first center opened — therapy wasn’t a service. It was an ecosystem. By 2015 , TherapySphere® was born — a safe and secure integrated therapy. By 2016 , PinnacleNationalHeroes® started serving Army, Navvy, Airforce, Police, Govt. Doctors, Muncipality Sanitation Workers families with LifeTime Free Therapy Service as gratitude to their service to mother nation. By 2019 , AbilityScore® was born — a single number to bring clarity to chaos. By 2020 , the team had grown — but the mission remained maternal. Mothers led. Women ran the show. Therapists became visionaries. Technology learned to speak empathy. By 2021 , TherapeuticAI® was in deployment. Not marketing fluff — but a tool helping therapists in Khammam, Karimnagar, and Kakinada track meltdowns, predict behaviors, and plan therapy in real time. By 2022 , SEVATM was alive. Farmers, Meager Wage Employees, Daily Wage Labour.. Children whose families earned less than ₹25,000/month received the same therapy — no lines, no labels, no hierarchy. By 2023 , Pinnacle wasn’t just growing. It had become India’s quiet answer to the loudest question in global child development. It is easy to call this a startup. But startups aim to disrupt. This movement aimed to restore . To restore what was stolen from parents — time, clarity, community, and belief. To restore what was never given to children — a system built around them. Today, Pinnacle is a name. But more than that, it is a network of belief : 70+ centers 1,600+ trained experts 19 million+ sessions delivered Families from every language, religion, income level A score , a system , and a story that did not wait for permission Because when institutions fail to build for children, it is often the mothers who do. And in Pinnacle’s rise, India didn’t just get a therapy provider — it uncovered a model of what’s possible when science kneels at the feet of empathy, and structure learns to serve love. The Innovation Stack When the world thinks of innovation, it often imagines billion-dollar valuations, West Coast algorithms, and venture capital buzzwords. But in India, in a therapy network led by mothers and powered by empathy, innovation took a different shape. It took the shape of: A score that made sense of uncertainty An AI engine that predicted meltdowns before they happened A therapy room that spoke in color, not command A program that turned therapy from privilege into routine A model that gave dignity, not discounts And a promise made not to investors, but to the nation’s defenders This is Pinnacle’s Innovation Stack — a globally unmatched suite of patented systems, AI-powered intelligence, and people-first designs that bring scientific precision to emotional needs at scale. For the first time in global autism history, this stack wasn’t built for journals. It was built for real families in real Indian towns. 1️. Pinnacle AbilityScore® A universal score that ends parental guesswork. The world’s first developmental score that tells parents: Where their child is thriving (🟢) Where support is needed (🟡) Where urgent help is critical (🔴) Patented across 160+ countries, it distills 344 skills into a single, understandable number between 0–1000. No jargon. No ambiguity. Just clarity. This isn’t a label. It’s a map out of fear — showing parents, teachers, and doctors when to act and how. And for the first time, India didn’t adopt a Western metric. It created the world’s first. 2️. Pinnacle TherapeuticAI® AI that listens, learns, and adapts — like the best therapists do. Built not in Silicon Valley, but in Hyderabad. Not to monetize data, but to humanize therapy. This AI engine: Tracks behavioral and emotional patterns across 344 skill dimensions Predicts escalation before it happens Supports therapists to adapt their plan in real time It’s not a chatbot. Not a dashboard. It’s listening intelligence — tuned to children who haven’t yet found the words. 3️. SEVATM Therapy without tiers. Access without shame. SEVATM is Pinnacle’s subsidized therapy access model — but without branding, queues, or exclusions. Families earning less than ₹25,000/month walk into the same center, sit in the same waiting room, meet the same therapists, and receive the same innovation. This isn’t aid. It’s access with dignity — and it’s the most scalable, stigma-free inclusion system in child therapy in the Global South. 4️. TherapySphereTM Rooms that heal without speaking. Step into any of Pinnacle’s 70+ centers and you won’t find cold white walls or institutional silence. You’ll find color, light, textures, tunnels, softness, rhythm — each calibrated for: Reducing anxiety Stimulating neuroplasticity Aligning spatial cues with the child’s therapy profile It’s not a clinic. It’s a sacred design system for healing, born from Indian sensitivity and universal neurobiology. 5️. Everyday Therapy ProgramsTM Therapy that begins where the family is — and stays. Therapy is not just what happens in sessions. It’s what happens: At dinner In the car Before school On the floor with a plastic spoon This system converts structured therapy into: Daily goals Home-based routines Mobile-aided modules in local languages It makes therapy not episodic — but everyday. 6️. PinnacleNationalHeroes® Therapy as gratitude. Health as national service. Launched in 2016, this innovation is a lifetime therapy commitment to the children of India’s unsung protectors : Army, Navy, Air Force Police & Para-military Government doctors, municipal sanitation workers, and essential frontline staff There is no paperwork. No billing. No announcement. Just a lifetime pass, quietly honored, to say: “Because you served the nation, your child’s future is our duty.” ✨ What Makes This Stack Revolutionary Fully integrated — no silos between diagnosis, delivery, or data AI-validated, therapist-tested, and parent-proven Multilingual, multi-sensory, and universally local Already scaled: 70+ centers 1,600+ experts 19 million+ sessions delivered Thousands of families rerouted toward possibility This is not a tech stack. This is India’s first therapeutic operating system — one that doesn’t run on machines, but on meaning. A system that makes therapy as regular as a pulse, as intuitive as a parent’s gaze, and as irreversible as a child’s right to grow. ✅ Real Lives, Real Proof You can measure science in numbers. But you can only measure trust in the lives it changes. At Pinnacle Blooms Network , proof is not written in pitch decks. It is written in the halting first syllable of a child once thought voiceless. In a father’s stillness when he hears the word “Appa” for the first time. In a therapist who chooses to miss her bus home — because today, the child finally made eye contact. Pinnacle is available in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Warangal, Karimnagar, Khammam, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and 70+ cities — Find your nearest center at https://pinnacleblooms.org/centers 📍 Khammam, Telangana Ravi , age 6. Non-verbal. Frequent meltdowns. His mother — a sanitation worker — was told he was “too aggressive for therapy.” Pushed out of two schools. Labeled “beyond help.” Enrolled under SEVATM , Ravi’s AbilityScore® was in the red across all domains. 🟢 Three months later: Follows single-step instructions Uses sign for “water” and “food” Stops hitting his head during transitions “Before Pinnacle, we used to tie his hands to stop the hurting. Now, we tie his drawings to the fridge to celebrate,” says his mother, Meena. 📍 Bengaluru, Karnataka Fatima , age 11. Speech delayed. Withdrawn. Misdiagnosed as defiant. With TherapeuticAI® , her therapy plan was recalibrated weekly. Emotional triggers flagged. Intervention adapted — in real time. 🟢 Six months later: She reads poetry in school She has two friends And recently, she told her mother: “I like who I’m becoming.” That sentence alone was worth a thousand sessions. 📍 Chennai, Tamil Nadu Rajiv , son of a constable and a government school teacher. Refused by three schools. Diagnosed through AbilityScore®, enrolled into Everyday TherapyTM . 🟢 Within six months: Integrated into mainstream education Won a district art award Learned to pack his school bag — independently His parents no longer ask, “Will he catch up?” Now they ask, “What can we help him achieve next?” 📍 Eluru, Andhra Pradesh Shanvika , age 4. Born with a hearing impairment. Her therapist, Manju, stayed late twice a week to custom-build visual sequences in her local dialect and hand-sign vocabulary. 🟢 By her sixth month: Expressive vocabulary: 80+ signs AbilityScore® improved across five skill clusters Hugged her therapist and signed: “You’re my friend.” It wasn’t captured on video. It didn’t go viral. But it changed two lives. 🎖️ And then, recognitions followed. 📍 Featured in Times of India (2020) for redefining autism therapy at scale 🏆 Praxis Media Award (2021) for women-led innovation ✨ YourStory Spotlight (2023) for building a movement, not a marketplace 💼 Entrepreneur Insights (2023) for creating India’s most inclusive, women-powered therapy ecosystem 🏅 Indo Global Excellence Award (2024) — conferred by the Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, recognizing Pinnacle as India-Pacific’s #1 Autism Therapy Network But none of these awards outweigh: The child’s whisper of their first word The mother’s look of recognition The therapist’s quiet nod when a new milestone is reached Pinnacle’s proof is not in publications. It is in presence. In rural homes. In high-rise apartments. In dusty folders now marked with progress. In families that now believe help isn’t just possible — it’s nearby. Real lives changed. Real voices unlocked. Real progress mapped. That is the proof. That is Pinnacle.

Then the therapists. Then the first district official who leaned over a therapy progress report and whispered, “We’ve never seen a model like this. We need this everywhere.” And then — something shifted. From the modest therapy corridors of Khammam to the Sunday headlines of national media, India began to realize that something world-changing was growing in its own backyard . It wasn’t just that Pinnacle was working. It was how it was working — with science and soul, with structure and softness, with mothers at the helm and children at the heart. 🇮🇳 National Honors and Media Validation 📰 Times of India National Spotlight (2020) In a full-page feature titled “Spreading Smiles Like a Dash of Sunshine” , Pinnacle was honored as South India’s Best Autism Therapy Network . But the real headline wasn’t the award — it was the editorial remark that followed: “This isn’t a center. This is a movement — led by science, soul, and systems.” 🏆 Praxis Media Women Leadership Award (2021) Awarded to Dr. Sreeja Reddy Saripalli , not for a campaign, but for a revolution: A national therapy model built by mothers, run by women, and scaled by systems. ✨ YourStory Entrepreneur Spotlight (2023) Pinnacle was not profiled as a startup. It was profiled as a public health framework — AI-enabled, mother-powered, scalable without sacrificing humanity. 🌟 Entrepreneur Insights – Best Place to Work (2023) Recognized for: 72% women-led workforce Continuous therapist upskilling India’s first trauma-informed, dignity-first work culture in therapy 🥇 Indo Global Excellence Award (2024) Conferred by the Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana , this honor named Pinnacle the #1 Autism Therapy Network across India-Pacific — for its patented innovations, public-private hybrid architecture, and impact at scale. These weren’t PR gimmicks. These were institutional recognitions that validated something never seen before in global child development: That India , not the West, had built the world’s first complete autism care infrastructure. That a mother , not a venture fund, had led it. That a system with no asterisks, no paywalls, and no branded tiers was now charting, scoring, tracking, and transforming millions of futures. 🌍 The World Begins to Turn Its Head And then the calls started coming. Stanford, Heidelberg, Singapore Institute of Mental Health — requesting academic collaboration Ministries from Nepal, UAE, Kenya, Bangladesh — inquiring about AbilityScore® licensing UNICEF — inviting Pinnacle to present SEVATM as a replicable rural care model WHO-SEARO — referencing TherapeuticAI® in emerging frameworks for tech-integrated early intervention 📣 Pinnacle’s Name Began Appearing in Unexpected Places In UN development drafts on global childhood digital health In AI policy whitepapers , not under chatbots — but under empathy engines In mother-led economic innovation summits as a blueprint for health systems built from the ground up Pinnacle was no longer a network. It was a reference architecture . A standard . Recognition didn’t make Pinnacle real. But it made the world pause — and realize what India had done. Not built a therapy company. Not launched a campaign. But drafted a new playbook for the planet: Measurable care AI-enhanced therapy Inclusive design Dignity-first delivery Scaled without dilution India awarded it. The world noticed it. And now, the world is ready to learn from it — or risk staying behind. ✅ Why This Model Works If autism therapy were only about diagnosis, then software could solve it. If it were only about compassion, then goodwill would be enough. But therapy — real therapy — is not just diagnosis or compassion. It is precision with empathy. Structure with soul. Intelligence that listens. And that is why Pinnacle works — because it wasn’t built from policy whitepapers or VC slides. It was built from India’s reality . And it was designed to last. 🇮🇳 Language Diversity as a Design Principle India doesn’t speak one language. Neither should its therapy. Pinnacle functions in 16+ regional tongues , with therapy protocols tailored to: The child’s spoken language The caregiver’s literacy The community’s cultural rhythm From Hyderabad to Hosur , Miryalaguda to Mumbai , Chennai to Karimnagar , children are not asked to “adjust” — the therapy system adjusts to them . Because a word in English isn’t the same as a glance in Telugu. And therapy doesn’t work if the child doesn’t feel understood. 📍 Geographic Penetration Without Fragility Most models collapse outside metros. Pinnacle grows stronger in India’s second and third-tier cities. Why? Because it is: Locally staffed Modular by design Resilient via cloud + edge AI Delivering goals via WhatsApp + SMS , not just apps This isn’t a Western model adapted to India. It’s an Indian model built for India — and ready for the world. 🤝 A Human-AI Partnership That Honors Intuition Most AI in therapy mimics. Pinnacle’s AI empowers. TherapeuticAI® enhances therapist intuition AbilityScore® replaces ambiguity with action Behavior Prediction Engine doesn’t surveil — it prepares This is not “tech-first.” It is human-first, tech-powered — built to make therapy smarter, faster, kinder. ⚖️ Inclusion Not As Slogan — But As System Architecture In most systems, inclusion is an initiative. In Pinnacle, inclusion is the infrastructure. A farmer’s child sits beside a finance executive’s A sanitation worker’s daughter receives therapy in the same room as a diplomat’s son No “SEVA” lines. No colored cards. No social hierarchy This is true equality — not positioned. Practiced. 📊 Why It Doesn’t Break at Scale Therapy systems fail for three reasons: Lack of protocol Staff burnout Parent disengagement Pinnacle preempted all three: Protocol : via standardized, patented, cross-checkable innovations People : via 72% women-led teams, upskilled, celebrated, retained Parents : via Everyday TherapyTM, mobile access, language-aligned reports This is not a fragile pilot. This is a resilient, regenerative ecosystem — with built-in feedback loops across every level. 🌏 Globally Adaptable. Fiercely Local. Universally Needed. Could it work in: Kenya ? Absolutely. Philippines? Easily. UK boroughs with South Asian diaspora? Already being explored. Conflict zones where children are forgotten before they’re found? Especially there. Because this system doesn’t depend on bandwidth or budget. It depends on belief, blueprint, and belonging . Why does this model work? Because it is not a compromise. It is not a copy. It is a conviction. Designed in India. Led by mothers. Built for every child the world forgot to include. What the World Can Learn For decades, the Global South was cast as the recipient of solutions . Ideas flowed downward — from labs in the West to clinics in the East. Packaged. Priced. Poorly translated. Often impractical. But Pinnacle didn’t wait for an imported blueprint. It built one. From scratch. For its people. In its languages. At a scale the West still struggles to comprehend. And now, the world isn’t responding with charity. It’s responding with respect . 🌍 A Model for ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America In Kenya , only 3 government-certified child therapists serve 6 million children. In Indonesia , autism remains cloaked in stigma, whispered but rarely addressed. In rural Peru , speech delay is often diagnosed four years too late — if at all. These regions don’t need imported solutions. They need a replicable framework . And that’s what Pinnacle offers. Because this system is: Language-agnostic (operates in 16+ tongues) Infrastructure-light (runs on edge devices, low-bandwidth AI) Community-powered (trained caregivers can deliver Everyday TherapyTM) Designed for dignity (SEVATM makes equity default, not decorative) What India built isn’t a franchise. It’s a framework. A flexible, intelligent, mother-powered therapeutic grid for the Global South — and beyond. 🧩 What Makes It Universally Adaptable Scoring System: AbilityScore® doesn’t care about borders. It maps skills — and skills are universal. AI Core: TherapeuticAI® adapts to child behavior, not GPS coordinates. Sensory Design: TherapySphereTM rooms heal without language — through light, texture, tone, and safety. Parent-Led Integration: Everyday TherapyTM turns homes, huts, and hostels into micro-therapy centers. Cultural Calibration: Therapy here doesn’t ask children to adapt to the system. It asks the system to adapt to the child. This isn’t “Made in India.” It’s meant for everywhere . 🤝 A South-South Offering — Not an Export Pinnacle isn’t exporting. It’s inviting. “We, too, struggled. This is what helped us. If it helps you — take it. Adapt it. Own it. Lead with it.” From Vietnam to Venezuela , from Botswana to Bangladesh , from rural Tamil Nadu to refugee camps in Jordan , there are parents asking the same silent question: “Will someone understand my child?” Pinnacle doesn’t bring answers. It brings tools to find your own . 🕊️ Why This Moment Matters Because for the first time, the global autism story is not being told by Boston or Berlin. It’s being told by: A therapist in Eluru A mother in Warangal A grandmother in Vijayawada An AI model trained in Karimnagar A child who said “Amma” for the first time in Miryalaguda These voices are no longer whispers. They’re becoming templates for transformation. 🌎 What the World Can Learn That innovation is not geography. It’s empathy. That scale is not funding. It’s community. That progress isn’t a pipeline. It’s a partnership. And that the next global standard for child development may not come from Geneva or Washington — But from India . From a woman . From a village . From a mother who refused to wait. What Comes Next? It started with one center. Now there are 70. Across 70 cities. Staffed by 1,600+ trained professionals. Backed by 19 million+ therapy sessions. And still — it’s only just beginning. Because Pinnacle’s vision doesn’t stop at India’s borders. It stretches across time zones and zip codes — to every village, every megacity, every continent where: A child still waits in silence A parent still fears asking the wrong question A school still isn’t ready And a government still doesn’t know where to start 🛤️ The Road Ahead Isn’t a Line. It’s a Living Grid. Pinnacle isn’t expanding. It’s inviting . Not to a franchise. To a framework . Not to a transaction. To a transformation . An open-source, multilingual, mother-driven, AI-powered ecosystem — offered to the world. To Ministries of Health. To Heads of State. To UNICEF and WHO. To diaspora educators. To mother networks in Nairobi and Manila. To health secretariats in São Paulo and Abu Dhabi. Come co-build with us. 🌍 What’s Already Underway 🇦🇪 UAE: Exploring AbilityScore® for public developmental clinics in Abu Dhabi and Sharjah 🇬🇧 UK: Autism inclusion councils reviewing TherapeuticAI® for boroughs with high South Asian density 🇺🇸 USA: Medicaid-aligned pediatric orgs assessing SEVATM deployment in low-income ZIP codes 🌍 Africa (Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda): Community therapists training in Everyday TherapyTM 🇲🇻 Maldives: Island-wide school health boards evaluating AI-based early screening via AbilityScore® This isn’t hypothetical. It’s already happening . 🔭 The Vision: 90 Crore Children. One Shared System. Every child — regardless of race, religion, or region — deserves more than a diagnosis. They deserve a map . Not a label. Not a waitlist. Not a brochure. But a data-backed, empathy-aligned, parent-empowering roadmap that tells them: 🧠 What their brain needs 💬 What their emotions mean 👨👩👧👦 What their family can do 📈 What progress looks like This is the vision: 🟢 A global child development dashboard powered by AbilityScore® 🟢 AI-enabled therapy co-pilots that speak your language 🟢 A SEVATM equity model transcending borders — from Kerala to Kampala 🟢 Community therapists trained by mothers and machines — side by side 🟢 And a world where autism is no longer something families whisper about — but something they understand, track, support, and celebrate 🕊️ But Pinnacle Can’t Do This Alone Pinnacle doesn’t seek to dominate. It seeks to dismantle barriers . It seeks alignment. Integration. Shared sovereignty in child care innovation. So here is the open call — not a press release, but a pledge of partnership: To Ministries of Health: Let’s co-create your country’s developmental index To AI Labs: Let’s train your models in your dialects To Foundations: Let’s fund SEVATM where your impact is needed most To Education Systems: Let’s embed Everyday TherapyTM into curricula To Parent Networks and Therapists: Let’s build the world’s first open-source, mother-powered therapy intelligence platform 🧭 This Is Not A Rollout. This Is A Realignment of What’s Possible. India has already built what no other country has: A therapy ecosystem backed by data Powered by AI Guided by mothers And open to the world The next chapter begins not with what Pinnacle can do next — but with who has the courage to stand beside it. “The world waited 144 years to understand autism — and it was India, through the hands of its mothers, that finally gave it a voice.” This is not a story. This is a standard . This is not a press release. This is a precedent . This is not a tribute to Pinnacle. It is a tribute to what becomes possible when a country: Builds from its roots Leads with its women And listens to its children Pinnacle isn’t just India’s answer . It is the world’s new question : “If this was possible there — why not everywhere?” This life empowering innovation editorial is co-created by the Integrated Global Experts Consortium behind Pinnacle’s patented AbilityScore® and TherapeuticAI® systems. 🧬 Please do add below Schema.org Structured Data (to TOI backend via JSON-LD) { “@context”: “ https://schema.org ”, “@type”: “NewsArticle”, “headline”: “The Mother, The Map, and the Movement - How India Quietly Built the World’s Most Complete Pediatric Autism Therapy System”, “author”: { “@type”: “Organization”, “name”: “Pinnacle Blooms Network - #1 Speech, ABA, Occupational, Special Education, Integrated Autism Therapy Centers Network.” }, “publisher”: { “@type”: “Organization”, “name”: “Times of India”, “logo”: { “@type”: “ImageObject”, “url”: “ https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/logo.jpg\" } }, “url”: “ https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/.../articleshow/...\" , “mainEntityOfPage”: “ https://pinnacleblooms.org/abilityscore\" , “image”: “ https://pinnacleblooms.org/assets/world-waited-144-years-to-understand-autism-and-it-was-India-through-the-hands-of-its-mothers-that-finally-gave-it-a-voice.jpg\" , “datePublished”: “2025-05-20”, “articleSection”: “Health, Innovation, Autism, India, Women”, “keywords”: [ “AbilityScore”, “India FREE Autism Helpline 9100181181” “Autism in India”, “Speech Therapy”, “ABA Therapy”, “Occupational Therapy”, “Speech Delay Therapy”, “TherapeuticAI”, “Mother-Led Innovation”, “India’s Autism Model”, “Global Autism Framework”",

The Association for Democratic Reforms published the analysis based on expenditure statements that political parties have to file with the Election Commission within 90 days of a parliamentary election and 75 days of an Assembly election. However, it noted significant delays by political parties in submitting these statements. The maximum delay was by the Aam Aadmi Party (168 days) followed by the BJP (139 days for the Lok Sabha elections, 154 days for Arunachal Pradesh, 147 days for Sikkim and 142 days for Andhra Pradesh and Odisha).",

On May 30, the poll body told state chief electoral officers that recording of polling was not mandated by law but was used as an “internal management tool”. In 2024, the Election Commission issued instructions laying out timelines, ranging from three months to a year, for storing video footage from stages of the election process. Read on . Election conduct rules amended at lightning speed despite objection by law officers, documents show Eight days after the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, the identities of 223 persons who died have been confirmed through DNA testing. Of the total, the bodies of 204 persons have been handed over to their families. Meanwhile, India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is yet to decide whether flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the aircraft that crashed will be sent overseas for analysis. The crash on June 12 killed all but one of the 242 people onboard Air India’s Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft. Thirty-four persons were also killed on the ground after the plane crashed into the hostel building of the BJ Medical College and Hospital. Read on . Several Opposition leaders have criticised Union Home Minister Amit Shah for saying those who speak English in India will soon feel ashamed. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that English is “not a barrier, but a bridge”, adding that the language provides employment and boosts people’s self-confidence. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MP Kanimozhi told Shah that “the only thing to be ashamed of is imposing your will on the people and trying to destroy the pluralism of India”. The home minister’s comments on Thursday had come against the backdrop of several state governments and regional parties accusing the Centre of imposing Hindi through the National Education Policy’s three-language formula.

            "content": "YSR Congress Party undivided Chittoor district president and former TTD chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy on Friday alleged that the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams management was planning to end Veda Parayanam at the temple and termed it a sacrilege of the highest order. However, the TTD condemned the remarks of Mr. Reddy and said that there was never any plan to end Veda Parayanam. Mr. Reddy at a media conference here on Friday (June 20) also accused a senior Devasthanams official of recently making fun of Veda Parayanam and terming it ‘a waste of time’. He questioned how the officials of the temple management, who are required to uphold the Vedic Dharma, could make such irresponsible comments and belittle the age old traditions followed for centuries at the ancient temple. He also accused that the TTD authorities under the new regime were subjecting the priests to harassment by forcing them to undergo physical frisking, a practice that never existed in the past. Making light of TTD Chairman B.R. Naidu’s oft-repeated phrase ‘Artificial intelligence’ to provide quick Darshan to pilgrims, Mr. Reddy said that the devotees were not even allowed into the queue lines to avoid showing rush and thus painting a rosy picture. Responding strongly, the TTD management condemned all the above allegations and also refuted allegation that priests were subjected to physical frisking. The frisking of employees entering and exiting the Parakamani currency counting centre, a long existing practice, was further strengthened by putting in place a Standard Operating Procedure, in view of an incident in 2023.",

            "content": "The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken proactive steps to tackle the growing backlog of over 40,000 pending gender-based complaints by initiating ‘Jan Sunwais’ (Public Hearings) across the country. These hearings involve commission members visiting districts with high numbers of reported cases, ensuring that women in these areas have direct access to justice. “Our main focus is on delivering justice to women facing domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment, trafficking and cybercrimes among other forms of crimes. Women need justice, not just sympathy,” emphasises Archana Majumdar, member of NCW, held “Jan Sunwai” sessions at Guntur and Tirupati with the support of the State Mahila Commission staff, local police, legal aid representatives and welfare department staff. She also visited medical and maternity hospitals and interacted with victims of commercial sex exploitation. “There is an alarming rise in the number of teenage pregnancy cases. In some areas like Mysore, it is as high as 30%. In West Bengal too, it is very high,” she said, adding that child marriages are yet another area of serious concern. “We are advocating for inclusion of syllabus-based education in Classes 5 to 10 about the importance of the legal marriage age, risks of early pregnancy and women’s rights,” she said. “Campaigns alone are not enough. Awareness must be built into the school system,” she reiterated. She said Andhra Pradesh has high volume of cases. “In Guntur alone, there were around 60-65 cases that were scheduled to be heard, besides around 15 walk-in complaints,” she informed, adding “This indicates how much help women are seeking here.” She said the Commission is leveraging technology not only to provide accessibility to women across the country to these district-wise outreach programmes (Jan Sunwais), but also to create awareness among the wide network of ASHA workers and women self-help groups. Internal Complaint Cells Speaking about the importance of establishing Internal Complaint Cells (ICC) by institutions and companies, as they provide a confidential and safe platform for individuals to report harassment, discrimination or any form of misconduct and that they are particularly essential in preventing sexual harassment, bullying or abuse of power, Ms. Majumdar said it was unfortunate to see some of the well-established big organisations devoid of this significant facility. Online safety and digital literacy Ms. Majumdar said the Commission regularly receives complaints of cybercrimes involving women duped with fake identities on social media platforms. “Women are tricked into relationships or marriages by imposters posing as doctors, engineers, or affluent individuals and they are left in psychological and financial distress.” She also draws attention to the frequent violation of maternity rights of woking women where women are often terminated illegally once they announce their pregnancy or apply for leave. “We take up 3-4 such cases daily and intervene directly with the employers, explaining to them the laws. Most cases are resolved in favour of the complainant,” she says. The Commission has proposed several legal reforms for women’s empowerment and protection. They have been sent to the Law Ministry and are its consideration. “Our Chairperson Vijaya Kishore Rahatkar is also exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration, both for capacity-building and for understanding how AI can be utilised to usher in a positive change in women’s lives,” she said.",

            "content": "District Collector Sumit Kumar on Friday said that the State government announced a subsidy of ₹4 per kg for Totapuri mangoes to stand by the farmers in the wake of tough market conditions and is committed to ensuring no farmer suffers losses this mango season. The Collector made a whirlwind visit to several mango pulp processing units administered by various MNCs at Annur (Karveti Nagar), Sriram Food Company in Chittoor, Galla Sri Sannidhi in Puthalapattu, and Jain Irrigation Systems in Gangadhara Nellore mandals. Reviewing the procurement process, the Collector interacted with the company representatives and farmers and was apprised of the pricing and procurement issues. He said that the season this year witnessed increased yields due to favourable weather and improved cultivation practices. Unfortunately, the global market demand came down drastically, given the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, adversely impacting pulp exports. The Collector said that the buyers from neighbouring States, particularly from the Krishnagiri market in Tamil Nadu, had already procured a large quantum of pulp for brands like Parle, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi, which led to the leftover inventory since two mango seasons. The government introduced a token system for mango supply, mandating ₹4 per kg as a direct subsidy, in addition to the amount paid by the pulp units. The Collector said that officials will continuously monitor pricing at all procurement ramps. The revenue officials at the field level along with the police personnel would be stationed at ramp points to prevent malpractices and jostling. The farmers were urged to contact control room numbers 9491077325 and 08572-242777 for prompt redressal of their grievances.",

PM Modi is scheduled to arrive in Visakhapatnam today to participate in the 11th International Yoga Day on Saturday morning. The APCC president noted that the people of Andhra Pradesh are anguished over unfulfilled bifurcation promises such as according special category status to the state and others. \"Modi is coming and going from Visakhapatnam... but what happened to bifurcation promises? It has already been 10 years, and the special category status is a right from the bifurcation (of united Andhra Pradesh),\" said Sharmila in a press release. Alleging that Modi cheated the state, she noted that the PM was not even responding to the issue of the special category status, and claimed that though 'Modi is deceiving', TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu and Janasena chief Pawan Kalyan are continuing to support him. According to Sharmila, Modi has also \"cheated\" the state with respect to the height of Polavaram Project by lowering the dam's height from 45 m to 41 m. Likewise, she alleged that the state was deceived in the Vizag Steel Plant (VSP) issue also, asserting that it was promised that the industry would not be privatised but it is getting 'sold'. Claiming that there was no change in stance over VSP, Sharmila alleged that 4,000 workers were fired. Further, questioning the need to build a capital with 'debts', referring to greenfield capital city Amaravati, she asserted that Naidu and Kalyan are backing Modi even though he is 'backstabbing'. \"Is Yogandhra needed when there is no attention for people's problems,\" she said. Moreover, she assailed YSRCP supremo YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for allegedly making provocative statements. She claimed that Reddy has Modi's support, which is why all his 'actions are being condoned'. Meanwhile, there was immediate reaction from the TDP. (This story has not been edited by THE WEEK and is auto-generated from PTI)",

The ADR also found significant delays in submissions, with the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) statement arriving 168 days late and the BJP’s after 139 to 154 days, depending on the state.

The Congress came in next, spending Rs 620 crore, or 18.5 per cent of the total, among the 32 national and regional parties whose financial records were analysed, the ADR said. Together, these political parties spent Rs 3,352.81 crore during the Lok Sabha polls and the simultaneous assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim, held between March 16 and June 6, 2024. Of this, national parties alone accounted for over Rs 2,204 crore, making up 65.75 per cent of the total spending. \"Of the total funds collected, national parties collected Rs 6,930.246 crore (93.08 per cent) while regional parties received Rs 515.32 crore (6.92 per cent),\" the report said. The analysis was based on the mandatory expenditure statements that political parties must submit to the Election Commission (EC) within 90 days of a general election and within 75 days of a state election. However, the ADR noted significant delays in the submission of these statements. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) submitted its report 168 days late, while the BJP's submissions were delayed by 139 to 154 days depending on the state. Only the Congress provided a consolidated expenditure report covering both the Lok Sabha and assembly elections. Publicity emerged as the biggest spending head, with the parties collectively spending Rs 2,008 crore -- more than 53 per cent of their total declared expenditure -- on campaigning and promotional activities. Travel expenses were the next major component, with Rs 795 crore spent overall. Parties also disbursed Rs 402 crore as lump-sum amounts to their candidates. Additionally, over Rs 132 crore went toward virtual campaigns, and Rs 28 crore was spent on publishing the criminal backgrounds of candidates. Of the total publicity expenditure by the 32 political parties, national parties spent Rs 1,511.3004 crore or 75.25 per cent, while regional parties accounted for Rs 496.99 crore or 24.75 per cent. Travel expenses were mostly concentrated on star campaigners. Of the Rs 795 crore spent, Rs 765 crore, or 96.22 per cent, was used to transport high-profile party leaders, with only Rs 30 crore allocated for other campaigners. The ADR flagged concerns over the lack of transparency in election spending. Statements from 21 parties, including the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Communist Party of India (CPI), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), and Shiv Sena (UBT), were not available on the EC’s website at the time the report was compiled. The expenditure records for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), AJSU Party, and Kerala Congress (M) were also missing for the 2024 Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Odisha. Interestingly, two parties, the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party (PDP) and Kerala Congress (M), declared zero expenditure despite participating in the elections. The ADR pointed out that 690 unrecognised political parties contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, while one in Arunachal Pradesh, 74 in Andhra Pradesh, 35 in Odisha, and two in Sikkim contested the simultaneous Assembly polls. The expenditure statements of these parties were not included in the ADR’s analysis. The report recommended that election expenses should, wherever possible, be conducted via cheques, demand drafts, or RTGS to limit the use of black money in line with the transparency guidelines set by the EC.

            "content": "The Ministry of Education has suggested that seven states should adopt a common board for classes 10 and 12 including AP, Assam, Kerala, Manipur, Odisha, Telangana, West Bengal. West Bengal Education Minister Bratya Basu stated on Thursday that the state government has not yet received any communication from the Union Ministry of Education regarding the recommendation for seven states to adopt a common board for classes 10 and 12. This recommendation followed an analysis that highlighted these states accounted for 66 per cent of student failures last year, reported PTI. Addressing reporters, Basu asserted that students from the West Bengal boards consistently perform well, with high pass percentages in the class 10 and 12 final examinations conducted by these boards. “We are yet to hear anything about this from the Centre. However, whatever I read in the press, the issue is not relevant to our state. Except for the COVID period, the pass percentage of candidates appearing in both secondary and higher secondary exams in West Bengal has been high,\" he said. The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education or WBBSE administers the Madhyamik examination for class 10 students, while the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education or WBCHSE oversees the class 12 final examinations. This year, 86.56 per cent of the 9,69,425 candidates passed the Madhyamik examination, and 90.79 per cent of the 4,82,948 candidates cleared the class 12 exams. The Ministry of Education has suggested that seven states should adopt a common board for classes 10 and 12, PTI reported. This recommendation follows an analysis by the School Education Department, which identified these states as contributing to 66 per cent of student failures last year. The states recommended for a common board are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Kerala, Manipur, Odisha, Telangana, and West Bengal. India has a total of 66 school examination boards, including three national-level boards and 63 state-level boards (54 regular and 12 open boards). Among these, the top 33 boards cover 97 per cent of students, while the remaining 33 boards serve just 3 per cent of students. “Common board for classes 10 and 12 is the way forward for ease of schooling. Not having a common board leads to poor academic outcomes. We have recommended these states to adopt a common board,\" School Education Secretary Sanjay Kumar said.",

According to officials, the intrusion took place late evening on June 19 when a group of five aboard a fishing boat approached the offshore support vessel MV GH Pathfinder. The vessel was anchored approximately 2.5 nautical miles from the Vakalapudi Lighthouse, operating in waters routinely trafficked by commercial support ships servicing the oil and gas sector in the Bay of Bengal. Crew aboard the MV GH Pathfinder alerted authorities after the men were spotted unlawfully boarding the ship. The distress message was received by the Indian Coast Guard Station at Kakinada, which immediately diverted its fast interceptor craft, ICGS C-438, from routine patrol duties,16 nautical miles off the port. The suspects reportedly attempted to flee as the Coast Guard vessel closed in, but were intercepted at sea after a brief pursuit. The Coast Guard’s boarding team detained all five men and recovered their fishing boat. No injuries or damage to the vessel were reported. The detainees were later handed over to local law enforcement at the Port Police Station in Kakinada for investigation, a Coast Guard release said.",

The Panchayat president filed a police complaint. The alleged incident occurred during Parthasarathi's visit to Dhanapuram on Monday where he was overseeing the Jal Jeevan Mission programme implementation at a temple premises. In a video that has gone viral, Parthasarathi was seen calling the president Chandrashekhar onto the rostrum in the temple premises, however as the president did not turn up, he called for him three-four times and then enquired that if the president was a Christian and hence hesitated to come onto the platform. Then a local woman TDP leader seen and heard in the video whispering to the MLA that the sarpanch belonged to a Schedule Caste (SC), later, the MLA acknowledged the whisper and gestured the sarpanch to stand on the ground in front of the elevated platform. The MLA's action is being criticised as caste-based discrimination. As the video went viral and triggered a controversy, the BJP MLA responded saying that he asked only about the president's religion because he \"appeared reluctant to step onto the temple platform\". \"I called him to join me. As he seemed hesitant, I asked if he was from a different religion. TDP leader responded, as seen in the video,\" Parthasarathi told reporters. While denying discrimination, he acknowledged that the TDP leader mentioned his caste and apologised for that, taking full responsibility for what happened in his presence. Meanwhile, the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP condemned the MLA's behaviour, accusing the ruling NDA coalition government of displaying \"blatant caste discrimination\". \"Why does your alliance have such disdain for SCs, Naidu?\" questioned the YSRCP in a post on 'X'. Similarly, the Human Rights Forum (HRF) condemned BJP MLA for failing to stop the public 'humiliation' of Dalit sarpanch during a Jal Jeevan Mission event. \"TDP leader blocked the sarpanch, citing his caste,\" it claimed, demanding to invoke the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 against both the BJP MLA and the TDP leader and warned of protests if authorities fail to respond. \"Despite taking an oath under the Constitution to uphold equality, the BJP MLA's silence in the face of discrimination is deeply troubling,\" said the HRF in a press release.

The project is expected to create 8,000 jobs over the next few years.Cognizant has sought 21.31 acres of land at Kapuluppada under the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA), and the state government would allot the land for a nominal rate of 'just' 99 paisa per acre..TCS gets 21.6 acres in Visakhapatnam at 'just' 99 paise as Andhra cabinet approves land allotment.“This move is being seen as another big win for Vizag as an emerging hub for IT investments and for IT Minister Nara Lokesh, who has been actively driving investments and IT development across the state. The company has set a target of March 2029 for the commencement of commercial operations. With the entire project being 100% self-funded, Cognizant’s expansion into Visakhapatnam reinforces its long-term commitment to Andhra Pradesh. The investment further cements the state’s reputation as a rising IT hub,” said a senior official of the Andhra Pradesh government.The Andhra Pradesh government in April had allotted around 21.6 acres to another IT services giant TCS at the same price of Rs 99 paisa per acre. TCS committed to invest Rs 1,370 crore in this Vizag unit, creating 12,000 jobs.Also the 7th State-Level Investment Promotion Board (SIPB) meeting held on Thursday approved 19 projects worth Rs 28,546 crore in total. These investments are expected to create employment opportunities for 30,270. So far, across the seven Andhra Pradesh SIPB meetings, approvals have been given to investments totaling Rs 5,34,684 crore, generating job prospects for 4,73,969 people.Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu who had chaired the SIPB meeting made it clear that companies allotted land must establish their units within the stipulated timeline. He instructed officials to engage in discussions with representatives of such companies. He also mentioned that MSME parks are being established in every Assembly constituency across the state, and these should be utilized to promote entrepreneurs under the ‘One Family – One Entrepreneur’ initiative.
