1. We are using two parts:
ðŸŸ¢ Backend: Built with Python (Flask)

ðŸ”µ Frontend: Built with React (JavaScript)

here first we need to deploy backend then that url will be used for the frontend environment variables

2. What software they need to install:

Please install the following:

Python 3.8 or newer

Node.js (version 18 or newer) and npm

Google Chrome or Chromium browser

MongoDB Atlas will be used â€” allow access to it

Internet access must be enabled (for API calls)

Allow the app to write files to a folder (for PDF reports)

3. Allow Internet Access to:

The server must allow outgoing internet access to:

newsdata.io â†’ for news fetching

generativelanguage.googleapis.com â†’ for Gemini AI

mongodb.net â†’ for connecting to MongoDB Atlas

4. System Access Needed:

The app will:

Run as a background service (continuously)

5. Security Notes:

I will provide the API keys (NewsData, Gemini, MongoDB).
Please help configure these securely (as environment variables if possible).

The environment variables of backebend:-
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://apikey07:HZgSO1eRfG5jnnhy@cluster0.163gb8q.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

    GEMINI_KEY=AIzaSyBzWdFvrveb9axN9z6zPL7auQHgoliOVk0

The environment variables of frontend:-
    VITE_BASE_URL="paste the url of deployed backendb url"

6. Commands to run:
